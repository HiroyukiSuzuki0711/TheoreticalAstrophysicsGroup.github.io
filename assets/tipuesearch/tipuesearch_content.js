{"title":"Density scratches and formation processes of primordial dark matter haloes via dry mergers","text":"<p>銀河の衝突・合体は、階層的構造形成理論において普遍的なものである。我々はそれらが銀河の形成・進化に与える影響について、N体シミュレー ションを用いて調べている。本セミナーでは最近得られた2つの結果について紹介する。\n1. 衝突する2つの系の間に質量比がある場合、小さな系(satellite)は力学摩擦によって軌道エネルギーや角運動量を失い、大きな系(host)の中 心部へと沈み込む。力学摩擦はChandrasekhar (1943)により導出された、基本的でかつ重要な物理過程である。Chandrasekharによると、satelliteの後ろ側にはhost内の粒 子の轍が形成されるはずであるが、これを数値シミュレーションによって直接示した例は数えるほどしかない。我々はN体シミュレーションによ り、hostの力学応答には轍だけでなく軸対称な成分も存在することを示す。さらにはそれらを再現する理論モデルを構築し、近傍の銀河に適用 した。\n2. Ishiyama (2014)は宇宙論的N体シミュレーションにより、コールドダークマター粒子の質量から期待される最小質量スケールのダークマターハローの形成・進化を 調べた。それによると、最小スケール付近のダークマターハローの中心部の密度カスプはNavarro-Frenk-Whiteモデルよりも鋭 く、成長とともに緩くなる。我々はN体シミュレーションを用いて、衝突・合体が最小スケール付近のダークマターハローの進化に与える影響を調 べ、Ishiyama (2014)の結果に理解を与える結果を得た。</p>\n\n","tags":"[\"DM Halo\", \"N-body simulation\", \"structure formation\"]","url":"/seminars/ja/2015/10/02/ogiya/"},
{"title":"What young stars' infrared variability reveals about protoplanetary disks","text":"<p>\nYoung stars' infrared emission shows several puzzling features: variability uncorrelated with visible-light changes, foreground extinction that recurs erratically on weekly timescales, and excesses over the stellar photosphere too large to explain with starlight absorbed and re-emitted by a hydrostatic protostellar disk.  I will discuss how each of these features can be explained by a time-varying, magnetically-supported disk atmosphere like those found in MHD calculations of magneto-rotational turbulence.  Through Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations I will show that such an atmosphere yields variability amplitudes as observed.  Since the starlight-absorbing surface lies higher than in hydrostatic models, a greater fraction of the stellar luminosity is reprocessed into the infrared, providing a natural explanation for the larger excesses. The atmosphere rises high enough to obscure the star in systems viewed near edge-on, and can explain the week-long extinction events, provided only that the dust in the outer parts of the disk has undergone some growth or settling, as likely required for planet formation to begin.</p>\n\n","tags":"[\"protoplanetary discs\", \"MHD\"]","url":"/seminars/ja/2015/10/06/turner/"},

{"title":"近傍矮小銀河で探る暗黒物質の正体","text":"<p>矮小銀河は階層的構造形成の枠組みの中で、大きな銀河を作る種として考えられ、また宇宙初期から存在する始原的な天体であると考えられている。よって、宇宙の構造形成や銀河の形成・進化を知る上で非常に注目すべき天体の１つである。さらに矮小銀河はダークマターが支配的な系であるため、ダークマターの基本的性質を知る上でも重要な天体であると言える。特にその質量構造は、宇宙を記述する理論的パラダイムである冷たい暗黒物質(Cold Dark Matter;CDM)理論が予言するそれと大きく異なっており、CDM理論の大きな問題点として物議を呼んでいる。本講演では、矮小銀河の動力学解析に基づいた暗黒物質の研究について紹介し、その現状と新たな問題点について議論していく。また、すばるHyper Suprime-Cam(HSC)やPrime Focus Spectrograph(PFS)を用いた矮小銀河研究の将来展望についても紹介する。</p>\n\n","tags":"[\"dark matter\", \"dwarf galaxies\"]","url":"/uchu_forum/ja/2015/10/14/hayashi/"},
{"title":"Studying the nature of Dark Matter with nearby dwarf galaxies","text":"<p>Dwarf galaxies are an important piece of the framework of hierarchical structure formation, being the building blocks for the formation of massive galaxies, and possibly one of the first objects to form. Dwarf galaxies therefore deserve attention as harboring important clues for the understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. Furthermore, dwarf galaxies are dark-matter dominated and are, thus, important objects for the study of the nature of dark matter. In particular, the density distribution of the dark matter is a particularly problematic because the observed structure differs markedly from the predictions of the cold dark matter paradigm. In this talk, I present an analysis on the dynamics of dwarf galaxies and will discuss further issues that arise as a result. I will also present the future prospects of studying dwarf galaxies with the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) and the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS).<p/>\n\n","tags":"[\"dark matter\", \"dwarf galaxies\"]","url":"/uchu_forum/en/2015/10/14/hayashi/"},
