<p>Today, second year Masters student Hiroyuki Suzuki from our group attended the finals of the 「Campus Life +1」contest and gave a presentation about his dreams and ambitions in life. From 2,000 participants from all over Japan, Suzuki won first prize! "To be honest, I didn't think my presentation went that well, and I thought I had blown it, but the judges were impressed and convinced by my dreams and motivations so I am very happy. I will keep on working hard to fulfill them." says Suzuki.</p>
