ABSTRACT
Recent observations of the cosmic microwave background by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe
strongly suggest that the reionization of the universe took place quite early (z ∼ 17 ). On the other hand, it has
been pointed out that the cold dark matter cosmology suffers from a substructure problem in which more
subgalactic halos are produced in the Local Group than dwarf galaxies. In this Letter, as a potential mechanism
for solving this problem, we consider the feedback effects of early reionization on the formation of small-scale
structures. For this purpose, we perform three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations, incorporating
the radiative transfer for ionizing photons. As a result, it is found that the early reionization is devastating for
low-mass systems with Mvir Շ 10 8 M, or vcirc Շ 20 km sϪ1 , and almost all gas is photoevaporated in more than
95% of low-mass systems. Such a strong negative feedback on the formation of low-mass galaxies may solve
the substructure problem and support the picture that Local Group dwarf galaxies are descendants of the more
massive halos that experienced and survived tidal stripping.
Subject headings: galaxies: dwarf — galaxies: formation — hydrodynamics — molecular processes —

effective for low-mass systems, since density fluctuations are
photoheated before they collapse to form stars.
Very recently, Kravtsov et al. (2004) analyzed the dynamical
history of small substructure halos with a present mass of
Շ108–109 M, using a cosmological simulation. They found
that 10% of small halos originate in considerably larger systems
with տ109 M, that survived the tidal stripping. They suggest
that the Galactic satellites are descendants of relatively massive
systems that formed at higher redshifts and did not significantly
suffer from the UVB. This argument is plausible if systems
with տ109 M, are impervious, even to early reionization, and
if star formation in low-mass systems is completely suppressed.
Kitayama et al. (2001) have investigated the UVB feedback
using a one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulation for
halos that collapse at z Շ 10 and found that the central parts
cannot cool down to form stars if the virial temperature is less
than 104 K and if I21 տ 10Ϫ2, where I21 is the intensity at the
Lyman limit in units of 10Ϫ21 ergs sϪ1 cmϪ1 HzϪ1 srϪ1. Dijkstra
et al. (2004) extended this work to higher redshifts by using
one-dimensional hydrodynamic calculations and found that gas
is not photoevaporated in halos with circular velocities of 10–
20 km sϪ1 at z 1 10. But, in the hierarchical structure formation
of a CDM universe, three-dimensional time-dependent selfshielding is significant for the UVB feedback, as shown by
Susa & Umemura (2004). In particular, such radiative transfer
effects are likely to be essential, when the reionization proceeds
at higher redshifts (in higher density intergalactic matter).
In this Letter, we perform three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations by solving the radiative transfer for
ionizing photons, and we attempt to elucidate the feedback
effects of early reionization on the formation of subgalactic
systems. In § 2, the method of numerical simulation is briefly
described, and the assumption for the ionizing radiation intensity is provided. In § 3, we present the numerical results for
UVB feedback and also make a convergence check of the

1. INTRODUCTION

It has been claimed that, compared to the dwarf galaxies
observed in the Local Group, too many subgalactic halos are
formed in a cold dark matter (CDM) universe (Klypin et al.
1999; Moore et al. 1999). One of the simplest ways to resolve
this discrepancy is to exclude baryonic matter from small halos
by the use of some feedback mechanisms. The mechanisms
could be either the gas ejection due to the energy input by
multiple supernova (SN) explosions (Dekel & Silk 1986; Yepes
et al. 1997; Efstathiou 2000; Kay et al. 2002; Marri & White
2003; Wada & Venkatesan 2003; Ricotti & Ostriker 2004) or
the photoevaporation by ultraviolet background (UVB) radiation (Umemura & Ikeuchi 1984; Bond et al. 1988; Efstathiou
1992; Babul & Rees 1992; Thoul & Weinberg 1996; Barkana
& Loeb 1999; Kitayama & Ikeuchi 2000; Kitayama et al. 2000;
Kitayama et al. 2001; Bullock et al. 2000; Somerville 2002;
Benson et al. 2002; Ricotti et al. 2002; Susa & Umemura 2004).
As for the former process, Wada & Venkatesan (2003) recently
performed high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations and concluded that 1000 SNe are required in order to disrupt a galaxy
with M ∼ 10 8 M, at z ∼ 10, while only 100 SNe in the halo
would trigger the recollapse of the whole system. These results
show that SN explosions are not always destructive to the
formation of low-mass galaxies, although it depends on the
initial mass function of stars (e.g., Ricotti & Ostriker 2004).
On the other hand, the previous studies on the UVB feedback
have shown that the photoevaporation by UVB is dependent
on the virial mass. As long as systems are more massive than
≈108 M,, the photoevaporation by the UVB is not effective
because deep potential wells can retain the ionized gas. However, at smaller mass scales, the feedback by the UVB is expected to play a very important role. Recently, using Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Kogut et al. (2003) suggested that the universe was reionized in a rather early epoch
(z ∼ 17). If this is the case, the UVB feedback could be quite

results. Section 4 is devoted to discussion of the substructure
problem.
2. NUMERICAL METHOD

The details of the numerical method are given in Susa &
Umemura (2004). Here, we briefly describe the model and
method for the simulations. The hydrodynamics are calculated
by using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method.
We use the version of SPH by Umemura (1993), with the
modification by Steinmetz & Mu¨ller (1993), and we also adopt
the particle resizing formalism of Thacker et al. (2000). The
gravitational force is calculated by a special-purpose processor
for gravity, GRAPE-6 (Makino 2002). In order to access the
GRAPE boards, we utilize the Heterogeneous Multi-Computer
System (HMCS; Boku et al. 2002), which allows us to use
GRAPE in parallel processors (such as PC clusters).
The softening length for gravity is set to be 20 pc for SPH
and CDM particles. This value is based on the convergence
test shown in § 3. The nonequilibrium chemistry and radiative
cooling for primordial gas are included with the code developed
by Susa & Kitayama (2000), in which H2 cooling and reaction
rates are taken from Galli & Palla (1998). To solve the radiative
transfer in an SPH scheme, we employ the method proposed
by Kessel-Deynet & Burkert (2000), which utilizes the neighbor lists of SPH particles to evaluate the optical depth from a
certain source to an SPH particle.
To generate UVB radiation, we use a single ionizing source
that is located very far from the simulated region, and we
control the UV intensity by specifying the incident flux to the
simulation box. We assume that the history of the UV intensity
allowed for the early reionization inferred by WMAP. Since
the recombination timescale is shorter than the Hubble expansion time at z տ 10 (Peebles 1968), ionizing photons should
be continuously supplied in order to retain the ionization. The
requisite UV intensity is given by equating the recombination
rate to the ionization rate:
In L p

n 0 (1 ϩ z) 3k rec h P (a ϩ 3) (1 Ϫ yH i ) 2
,
4pjn L
yH i

(1)

where In L denotes the intensity at the Lyman limit; k rec , jn L, and
h P represent the recombination coefficient, the ionization cross
section at the Lyman limit, and the Planck constant, respectively; n 0 is the present-day baryon density; a is the spectral
index of UV radiation; and yH i is the fraction of neutral hydrogen. If yH i p 0.1 at z Ӎ 15, I21 Ӎ 10Ϫ3 is required. This
should be regarded as the minimal prerequisite for two reasons.
First, this estimate is provided for optically thin media. In actual
ionization history, the radiative transfer effect is definitely important (Nakamoto et al. 2001). Second, in an inhomogeneous
universe, local density enhancements increase the recombination rate significantly. Taking these two reasons into account,
we assume I21 p 0.01 for 5 ! z ! 17 with a sharp decrease at
z 1 17 as I21 ∝ exp [3 (17 Ϫ z)]. Also, some models with
I21 p 1 are simulated to investigate the dependence on I21.
The “star formation” condition adopted in this Letter is basically the same as that in Susa & Umemura (2004), except
that c ∗ p 1 is assumed here; c ∗ p 1 means the star formation
at the maximal feasible rate, because no stars can form in a
timescale shorter than the local free-fall time. Here, we do not
include the internal feedback effects by stellar UV radiation or
by SN explosions.

We assume QM p 0.3, QL p 0.7, Q baryon h 2 p 0.02, and
h p 0.7, as the background cosmology. Following the density
fluctuations in this cosmology, the initial distributions of particles are set up. The mass of the virialized dark halo is in the
range of 10 6 M, Շ Mvir Շ 10 8 M,, and the collapse epoch is
5 Շ z c Շ 20. We use 215 SPH particles and 215 dark matter
particles for a run.
3. RESULTS

The numerical results are summarized in Figure 1. The left
panel shows the fraction of the final mass in the stellar component to the initial baryon mass as a function of the collapse
epoch z c and Mvir, while the right panel is the final fraction of
gas. In both panels, the fraction is depicted by different symbols. The dotted lines represent the collapse epoch of halos
formed from 1 j, 2 j, and 3 j CDM density fluctuations.
Roughly 95% of fluctuations collapse after the epoch predicted
by the 2 j line. The dashed lines denote the constant circular
velocities, which are defined by vcirc { (GMvir /rvir )1/2 with the
virial radius rvir determined by z c and Mvir.
In Figure 1, we see that if Mvir տ 10 8 M, and vcirc տ 20
km sϪ1, almost all baryons are transformed into stars, leaving little
gas. It is noted that a considerable fraction of baryonic matter
forms stars even after the reionization (z c ! z reion p 17). On the
other hand, if vcirc Շ 20 km sϪ1, fstar steeply decreases with decreasing circular velocities. Also, fgas becomes quite small, as seen
in the right panel. This reflects the effect of photoevaporation by
the UVB. The dependence of photoevaporation on Mvir and z c is
understood by the self-shielding and by the gravitational potential.
The self-shielding against the UVB becomes prominent if the local
density exceeds the threshold density as

(Tajiri & Umemura 1998). This means that the self-shielding
is more effective if the system is larger or if it collapses at
higher redshifts. The gas envelope that is not shielded from
the UVB is photoheated to Շ104 K and is blown out by the
enhanced thermal pressure, unless the gravitational potential is
deep enough to retain the ionized gas (i.e., vcirc տ 20 km sϪ1).
Hence, the photoevaporation is quite devastating for fluctuations with lower masses and later collapse epochs. Intriguingly,
a steep transition of fstar for vcirc Շ 20 km sϪ1 coincidentally
lies on a line of nearly constant j; i.e., dr/r ≈ 2 j. This means
that in more than 95% of the halos with vcirc Շ 20 km sϪ1, the
star formation is strongly suppressed by early reionization.
In the present simulation, star formation is assumed to proceed
in local free-fall time. This leads to the physically maximal star
formation rate. Hence, the stellar fraction obtained in a halo should
be regarded as a maximal one. If the star formation proceeds for
a longer timescale, baryon gas in a halo with vcirc Շ 20 km sϪ1
could be almost completely photoevaporated after the reionization.
On the other hand, fluctuations with vcirc տ 20 km sϪ1 are likely
to be impervious to the photoevaporation since the gravitational
potential is deep enough to retain the ionized gas.
To examine the dependence of the results on the assumed
UVB intensity (I21), we also perform several runs with I21 p
1. In this case, a steep transition of fstar is slightly shifted to
higher j as dr/r ≈ 2.5 j. Thus, it turns out that the results are
not strongly dependent on the UVB intensity. Such insensi-

symbols: f 1 0.9 (filled circles), 0.5 ! f ! 0.9 (filled squares), 0.1 ! f ! 0.5 (filled triangles), 0.01 ! f ! 0.1 (open triangles), 10Ϫ3 ! f ! 0.01 (open squares), and

the constant circular velocities of 5, 10, and 20 km sϪ1.

tiveness may be understood as the weak dependence of the
self-shielding on the UV intensity, as seen in equation (2).
Finally, to check the numerical effects, we analyze the convergence of the runs by changing the mass resolution and softening
length. In Figure 2, the left panel shows the final stellar fraction
(fstar) in runs with Mvir p 6 # 10 7 M, and z c Ӎ 10, while the

right panel shows fstar in runs with Mvir p 6 # 10 6 M, and
z c Ӎ 15. These runs are at the transition region of fstar in Figure 1. The horizontal axis in Figure 2 represents the softening
length e for gravity. The four different curves correspond to the
different numbers of particles used in the simulations. We can see
that fstar almost converges, if NSPH տ 2 15 and if e Շ 10–20 pc.

horizontal axis represents the softening length of the gravitational force. The four different curves correspond to the different numbers of particles: NSPH p 217
(circles), NSPH p 215 (crosses), NSPH p 214 (triangles), and NSPH p 213 (squares).

Thus, the present simulation with e p 20 pc and NSPH p 2 15
(pNDM) is unlikely to suffer from numerical effects.
4. DISCUSSION

The present numerical simulations predict strong negative
feedback on the formation of dwarf galaxies with vcirc Շ 20
km sϪ1. Based on fstar, we can make a rough estimation of the
mass-to-light ratios (M/L ) for fully formed galaxies. If we assume Mstar /L p 3 for stars in solar units, fstar p 0.01 corresponds to Mvir /L p 2.6 # 10 3, and fstar p 0.1 to Mvir /L p
2.6 # 10 2. But these values cannot be compared directly with
the observed M/L of satellite galaxies because quite a large
fraction (typically more than 90%) of the dark matter halos of
satellites can be tidally stripped, as shown by Kravtsov et al.
(2004). Thus, the eventual M/L of satellites is likely to decrease
by a factor of 10; e.g., M/L p 2.6 # 10 2 for fstar p 0.01. Local
Group dwarf galaxies (dwarf spheroidal and dwarf irregular
galaxies) exhibit a wide range of M/L, from a few up to ≈100
(van den Bergh 1999; Mateo 1998; Hirashita et al. 1998).
Hence, the formed galaxies with fstar տ 0.01 may account for
the Local Group dwarf galaxies. The present simulation predicts that only a few percent of fluctuations result in
fstar տ 0.01, if vcirc Շ 20 km sϪ1. If the star formation rate is
lower, the probability is reduced further. Hence, such intrin-

Vol. 610

sically low-mass halos may be too few to account for all the
Galactic satellites.
One possibility for reconciling this discrepancy could be
found in the model suggested by Kravtsov et al. (2004). They
found that 10% of small halos originate in considerably larger
systems with տ109 M, that survived the tidal stripping, and
they suggest that the Galactic satellites are descendants of relatively massive systems that formed at higher redshifts. In our
simulation, systems larger than 108 M, are not subject to the
UVB feedback. Thus, their model seems likely to account for
the number of Local Group dwarf galaxies.
