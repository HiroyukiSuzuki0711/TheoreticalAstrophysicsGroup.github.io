 abstract = "{The smallest dark matter halos are formed first in the early universe.
According to recent studies, the central density cusp is much steeper in
these halos than in larger halos and scales as {$\rho$}vpropr
$^{-(1.5 -1.3)}$. We present the results of very large
cosmological N-body simulations of the hierarchical formation and
evolution of halos over a wide mass range, beginning from the formation
of the smallest halos. We confirmed early studies that the inner density
cusps are steeper in halos at the free streaming scale. The cusp slope
gradually becomes shallower as the halo mass increases. The slope of
halos 50 times more massive than the smallest halo is approximately
-1.3. No strong correlation exists between the inner slope and the
collapse epoch. The cusp slope of halos above the free streaming scale
seems to be reduced primarily due to major merger processes. The
concentration, estimated at the present universe, is predicted to be
60-70, consistent with theoretical models and earlier simulations, and
ruling out simple power law mass-concentration relations. Microhalos
could still exist in the present universe with the same steep density
profiles.

 abstract = "{Observations have revealed interesting universal properties of dark
matter (DM) haloes especially around low-mass galaxies. Strigari et al.
showed that DM haloes have common enclosed masses within 300 pc
(Strigari relation). Kormendy {\amp} Freeman reported DM haloes having
almost identical central surface densities (the {$\mu$}$_{0D}$
relation). In addition, there exists a core-cusp problem, a discrepancy
of the central density distribution between simulated haloes and
observations. We investigate whether a scenario where cuspy haloes
transform into cores by some dynamical processes can also explain their
universal structural properties. It is shown that a cusp-to-core
transformation model naturally reproduces the {$\mu$}$_{0D}$ relation
and that Strigari relation follows from the {$\mu$}$_{0D}$ relation
for dwarf galaxies. We also show that the central densities of cored
dark haloes provide valuable information about their formation
redshifts. L121

 abstract = "{We present a method to couple N-body star cluster simulations to a
cosmological tidal field, using AMUSE (Astrophysical Multipurpose
Software Environment). We apply this method to star clusters embedded in
the CosmoGrid dark matter only Lambda cold dark matter simulation. Our
star clusters are born at z = 10 (corresponding to an age of the
universe of about 500 Myr) by selecting a dark matter particle and
initializing a star cluster with 32 000 stars on its location. We then
follow the dynamical evolution of the star cluster within the
cosmological environment. We compare the evolution of star clusters in
two Milky Way size haloes with a different accretion history. The
mass-loss of the star clusters is continuous irrespective of the tidal
history of the host halo, but major merger events tend to increase the
rate of mass-loss. From the selected two dark matter haloes, the halo
that experienced the larger number of mergers tends to drive a smaller
mass-loss rate from the embedded star clusters, even though the final
masses of both haloes are similar. We identify two families of star
clusters: native clusters, which become part of the main halo before its
final major merger event, and the immigrant clusters, which are accreted
upon or after this event; native clusters tend to evaporate more quickly
than immigrant clusters. Accounting for the evolution of the dark matter
halo causes immigrant star clusters to retain more mass than when the z
= 0 tidal field is taken as a static potential. The reason for this is
the weaker tidal field experienced by immigrant star clusters before
merging with the larger dark matter halo.

 abstract = "{We present the results of the ''Cosmogrid'' cosmological N-body simulation
suites based on the concordance LCDM model. The Cosmogrid simulation was
performed in a 30 Mpc box with 2048$^{3}$ particles. The mass of
each particle is 1.28 {\times} 10$^{5}$ M $_{&sun;}$, which
is sufficient to resolve ultra-faint dwarfs. We found that the halo mass
function shows good agreement with the Sheth {\amp} Tormen fitting
function down to \~{}10$^{7}$ M $_{&sun;}$. We have analyzed
the spherically averaged density profiles of the three most massive
halos which are of galaxy group size and contain at least 170 million
particles. The slopes of these density profiles become shallower than
-1 at the innermost radius. We also find a clear correlation of
halo concentration with mass. The mass dependence of the concentration
parameter cannot be expressed by a single power law, however a simple
model based on the Press-Schechter theory proposed by Navarro et al.
gives reasonable agreement with this dependence. The spin parameter does
not show a correlation with the halo mass. The probability distribution
functions for both concentration and spin are well fitted by the
log-normal distribution for halos with the masses larger than
\~{}10$^{8}$ M $_{&sun;}$. The subhalo abundance depends on
the halo mass. Galaxy-sized halos have 50\% more subhalos than
\~{}10$^{11}$ M $_{&sun;}$ halos have.

Regardless of the network latency of 0.32 s and the communication over

largest obstacle is introduced by local scheduling and reservation

these microhalos. We found that microhalos have the central density
cusps of the form {$\rho$} vprop r $^{-1.5}$, much steeper than the
cusps of larger dark halos. The central regions of these microhalos
survive the encounters with stars except in the very inner region of the
galaxy down to the radius of a few hundreds parsecs from the galactic
center. The annihilation signals from the nearest microhalos are
observed as gamma-ray point sources (radius less than 1'), with
unusually large proper motions of \~{}0.2 deg yr$^{-1}$. Their
surface brightnesses are \~{}10\% of that of the galactic center. Their
signal-to-noise ratios might be better if they are far from the galactic
plane. Luminosities of subhalos are determined only by their mass, and
they are more than one order of magnitude more luminous than the
estimation by Springel et al.: a boost factor can be larger than 1000.
Perturbations to the millisecond pulsars by gravitational attractions of
nearby Earth-mass microhalos can be detected by the observations of
Parkes Pulsar Timing Array.

large halo-to-halo variations. The results of recent
ultra-high-resolution runs fall within the variation of our samples. We
found that the concentration parameter and the radius at the moment of
the maximum expansion show fairly tight correlation with the subhalo
abundance. This correlation suggests that the variation of the subhalo
abundance is at least partly due to the difference in the formation
history. Halos formed earlier have a smaller number of subhalos at
present.

that if scaled by the velocity dispersion of the parent halo, the
subhalo velocity distribution functions of galaxy-sized and
cluster-sized halos are identical. For cluster-sized halos, the
simulation results agreed well with the observations. The simulations,
however, predicted far too many subhalos for galaxy-sized halos. Our
galaxy has several tens of known dwarf galaxies. On the other hand,
simulated dark-matter halos contain thousands of subhalos.  We performed
a simulation of a single large volume, and measured the abundance of
subhalos in all massive halos. We found that the variation of the
subhalo abundance is very large, and those with the largest number of
subhalos correspond to the simulated halos in previous studies.  The
subhalo abundance depends strongly on the local density of the
background. Halos in high-density regions contain a large number of
subhalos. Our Galaxy is in the low-density region. For our simulated
halos in low-density regions, the number of subhalos is within a factor
of four to that of our Galaxy.  We argue that the ``missing dwarf
problem'' is not a real problem, but is caused by biased selections of
the initial conditions in previous studies, which were not appropriate
for field galaxies.
