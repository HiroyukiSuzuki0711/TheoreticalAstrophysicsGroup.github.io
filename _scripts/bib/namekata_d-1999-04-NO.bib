 abstract = "{We investigate the properties of massive, dense clouds formed in a
barred galaxy and their possible relation to star formation, performing
a two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation with the gravitational
potential obtained from the 2MASS data from the barred spiral galaxy,
M83. Since the environment for cloud formation and evolution in the bar
region is expected to be different from that in the spiral arm region,
barred galaxies are a good target to study the environmental effects on
cloud formation and the subsequent star formation. Our simulation uses
for an initial 80 Myr isothermal flow of non-self gravitating gas in the
barred potential, then including radiative cooling, heating and
self-gravitation of the gas for the next 40 Myr, during which dense
clumps are formed. We identify many cold, dense gas clumps for which the
mass is more than 10$^{4}$ M$_{&sun;}$ (a value
corresponding to the molecular clouds) and study the physical properties
of these clumps. The relation of the velocity dispersion of the
identified clump's internal motion with the clump size is similar to
that observed in the molecular clouds of our Galaxy. We find that the
virial parameters for clumps in the bar region are larger than that in
the spiral arm region. From our numerical results, we estimate star
formation in the bar and spiral arm regions by applying the simple model
of Krumholz {\amp} McKee (2005). The mean relation between star
formation rate and gas surface density agrees well with the observed
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. The star formation efficiency in the bar
region is {\tilde}60 per cent of the spiral arm region. This trend is
consistent with observations of barred galaxies.
