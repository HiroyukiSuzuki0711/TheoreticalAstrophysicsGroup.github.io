 abstract = "{We explore the impacts of ultraviolet (UV) radiation feedback on
galaxies during the epoch of reionization by cosmological simulations in
which hydrodynamics and the transfer of the H and He ionizing photons
are consistently coupled. Moreover, we take into account H$_{2}$
non-equilibrium chemistry, including photodissociation. The most
striking feature of the simulations is a high spatial resolution for the
radiative transfer (RT) calculation which enables us to start
considering not only external UV feedback processes but also internal UV
feedback processes in each galaxy. We find that the star formation is
significantly suppressed due to the internal UV and supernova (SN)
feedback. In low-mass galaxies with M {\lt} 10$^{9}$
M$_{&sun;}$, a large amount of gas is evacuated by
photoevaporation as previous studies have shown, which results in the
suppression of star formation. Surprisingly, star formation in massive
haloes is also strongly suppressed despite the fact that these haloes
hardly lose any gas by photoevaporation. The suppression of star
formation in massive haloes is mainly caused by the following two
factors: (i) small-scale clumpy structures in the galaxies are
smoothened by the internal feedback; (ii) although the dense gas in the
galaxies is mostly neutral, the H$_{2}$ formation and cooling
processes are disturbed by mild photoheating. Photodissociating
radiations actually suppress star formation, but the magnitude of the
effect is not so large in massive galaxies. Even though our simulation
volume is too small to be a representative patch of the Universe during
reionization, we find that our simulated star formation rate densities
and H i fractions at z {\tilde} 6-7 are consistent with those found in
observations.

 abstract = "{We explore the formation of secondary Population III (Pop III) stars
under radiation hydrodynamic (RHD) feedback by a preformed massive star.
To properly treat RHD feedback, we perform three-dimensional RHD
simulations incorporating the radiative transfer of ionizing photons as
well as H$_{2}$ dissociating photons from a preformed star. A
collapsing gas cloud is settled at a given distance from a 120 M
$_{sun}$ Pop III star, and the evolution of the cloud is pursued
including RHD feedback. We derive the threshold density depending on the
distance, above which the cloud can keep collapsing owing to the
shielding of H$_{2}$ dissociating radiation. We find that an
H$_{2}$ shell formed ahead of an ionizing front works effectively
to shield the H$_{2}$ dissociating radiation, leading to the
positive feedback for the secondary Pop III star formation. Also, near
the threshold density, the envelope of gas cloud is stripped
significantly by a shock associated with an ionizing front. By comparing
the mass accretion timescale with the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale, we
estimate the mass of secondary Pop III stars. It turns out that the
stripping by a shock can reduce the mass of secondary Pop III stars down
to {\ap}20 M $_{sun}$.

 abstract = "{We present a novel scenario for globular cluster (GC) formation, where
the ultraviolet (UV) background radiation effectively works so as to
produce compact star clusters. Recent observations on the age
distributions of GCs indicate that many GCs formed even after the cosmic
reionization epoch. This implies that a significant fraction of GCs
formed in UV background radiation fields. Also, the star formation in an
early-generation of subgalactic objects may be affected by strong UV
radiation from pre-formed massive stars, e.g. Population III stars.
Here, we explore the formation of GCs in UV radiation fields. For this
purpose, we calculate baryon and dark matter (DM) dynamics in spherical
symmetry, incorporating the self-shielding effects by solving the
radiative transfer of UV radiation. In addition, we prescribe the star
formation in cooled gas components and pursue the dynamics of formed
stars. As a result, we find that the evolution of subgalactic objects in
UV background radiation is separated into three types: (i) prompt star
formation, where less massive clouds
(\~{}10$^{5-8}$M$_{solar}$) are promptly self-shielded and
undergo star formation, (ii) delayed star formation, where photoionized
massive clouds ({\gt}\~{}10$^{8}$M$_{solar}$) collapse despite
high thermal pressure and are eventually self-shielded to form stars in
a delayed fashion, and (iii) supersonic infall, where photoionized less
massive clouds (\~{}10$^{5-8}$M$_{solar}$) contract with
supersonic infall velocity and are self-shielded when a compact core
forms. In particular, the type (iii) is a novel type found in the
present simulations, and eventually produces a very compact star
cluster. The resultant mass-to-light ratios, half-mass radii and
velocity dispersions for the three types are compared to the
observations of GCs, dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) and ultracompact dwarfs
(UCDs). It turns out that the properties of star clusters resulting from
supersonic infall match well with those of observed GCs, whereas the
other two types are distinct from GCs. Hence, we conclude that
supersonic infall in a UV background is a promising mechanism to form
GCs.
