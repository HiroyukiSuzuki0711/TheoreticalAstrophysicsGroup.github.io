 abstract = "{Introduction. It is very important for astronomical study and
observation to operate a telescope by oneself. However, there are
various problems such as the cost and location to use the telescope. The
most promising technology that solves those problems is a remote
telescope system. However, an old and usual remote telescope system was
Server {\amp} Client type system. Therefore, the remote telescope owners
and the remote telescope users have to manage their telescope by
themselves. Especially, enough knowledge of the network, the time and
cost to control the telescopes are necessary for the remote telescope
owners. So it is difficult for general telescope owners to offer their
telescopes as remote telescopes. We are developing a new environment
that manages the remote telescopes. The environment connects users who
want to use telescopes with the telescopes connected with PC (RS232c,
USB, etc) all over the world. Our goal is to develop an environment by
which users are able to cooperate and to share a lot of telescopes and
the observational data for the education and the observation. Methods.
Our remote telescope system is established on the P2P agent network.
Various agents execute tasks allocated instead of users. (to retrieve,
to connect, to control, etc) So users needn't do irksome tasks. Our
system mounts LL-Net (Location-based Logical Network). LL-Net can manage
user nodes on the P2P network by a key made based on location
information. Our system key is allocated by the longitude and latitude.
Results and Discussion. Users can retrieve remote telescopes that suit
them and connect with them. Telescope owners can make their telescopes
remote telescopes without troublesome jobs. Logical network constructed
with LL-Net enables telescopes which the user hoped to be retrieved
efficiently. We investigate more suitable use of LL-Net for a remote
telescope. We plan to realize to share the observational data and to
make remote telescopes cooperate.

formation simulations, previous studies can not consider multiphase
structures of the ISM which should strongly affect galaxy properties.
For instance, the size of disk galaxies formed in numerical simulations
is smaller than that of observed galaxies.

In this study, by increasing the numerical resolution, we take into
account the multiphase structure of ISM produced by radiative cooling,
UV heating and supernova feedback. We simulate evolutions of multiphase
ISM in a gas-rich dwarf galaxy, and obtain various aspects corresponding
to gas-rich dwarf galaxies, especially, giant molecular cloud
associations and superbubbles produced by subsequent supernovae.

The cloud mass function in our models has a power law form with index
{$\alpha$} {\tilde}-1.7 which agrees well with the observed values {$\alpha$}
{\tilde} -1.5 to -2.0. The bubble size approximately corresponds to the
scale height of a warm (10$^{3}$ K{\lt} T{\lt}10$^{4}$ K)
disk.

Our numerical results show that feedback by SNe plays  a very important
role in regulation of ISM evolution in a gas-rich dwarf galaxy.
