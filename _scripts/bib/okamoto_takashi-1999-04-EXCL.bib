 abstract = "{By use large cosmological Smoothed-Particle-Hydrodynamics simulations,
we explore observed properties of Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs). We
develop a phenomenological model of absorption, scattering and escape of
Lyman alpha (Ly{$\alpha$}) photons motivated by Neufeld (1991). In our
model, we assume that the clumpiness of the inter-stellar medium in a
galaxy is correlated with the larger scale substructure richness. As a
result, we reproduce, for the first time, all of the following observed
properties of LAEs at z=3.1: Ly{$\alpha$} luminosity function, UV
luminosity function of LAEs, the angular correlation function and the
equivalent width distribution of Lya line. In this poster, we will
discuss not only the statistical properties of LAEs at the other
redshift (z = 2 \~{} 6), but also the relation between LAEs and the other
high-z galaxies such as Lyman break galaxies and Submm galaxies.

considered to be end products of galactic mergers and the latter to form
via secular evolution of galactic disks. Observationally, bulges of disk
galaxies are mostly pseudobulges, including the Milky Way's. We here
show, by using self-consistent cosmological simulations of galaxy
formation, that the formation of pseudobulges of Milky Way-sized disk
galaxies has mostly completed before disk formation; thus the main
channel of pseudobulge formation is not secular evolution of disks. Our
pseudobulges form by rapid gas supply at high-redshift and their
progenitors would be observed as high-redshift disks.

subsystems formed in a high resolution hydrodynamic simulation of a

magnitude in luminosity but have a very similar mass within their inner
600 pc with very little scatter. This is in agreement with the recent
measurements for dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Interestingly,
subhaloes with circular velocity around 20 km/s sometimes host
satellites that are as bright as the classical satellites and sometimes
they are found as completely dark objects. We find that there is a
critical circular velocity at the epoch of reionization, below which
haloes fail to host star formation and found as ``dark satellites''
today.

visualizing the development of structure in the universe during the 13.7
billion years from the Big Bang to the present day. Aimed at a general
audience for the Royal Society's 2005 Summer Science Exhibition, the
movie illustrates how the latest cosmological theories based on dark
matter and dark energy are capable of producing structures as complex as
spiral galaxies and allows the viewer to directly compare observations
from the real universe with theoretical results. 3D is an inherent
feature of the cosmology data sets and stereoscopic visualization
provides a natural way to present the images to the viewer, in addition
to allowing researchers to visualize these vast, complex data sets. The
presentation of the movie used passive, linearly polarized projection
onto a 2m wide screen but it was also required to playback on a Sharp
RD3D display and in anaglyph projection at venues without dedicated
stereoscopic display equipment. Additionally lenticular prints were made
from key images in the movie. We discuss the following technical
challenges during the stereoscopic production process; 1) Controlling
the depth presentation, 2) Editing the stereoscopic sequences, 3)
Generating compressed movies in display specific formats. We conclude
that the generation of high quality stereoscopic movie content using
desktop tools and equipment is feasible. This does require careful
quality control and manual intervention but we believe these overheads
are worthwhile when presenting inherently 3D data as the result is
significantly increased impact and better understanding of complex 3D
scenes.

model. By considering minor burst, the observed morphology-radius
relation is successfully reproduced. When we do not consider minor
burst, the RPS hardly increases the intermediate B/T population. In
addition, the RPS and minor burst are not important for colours or star
formation rates of galaxies in the cluster core if star formation
time-scale is properly chosen, because the star formation is
sufficiently suppressed by consumption of the cold gas. We also find
that SF in bulge-dominated galaxies is mainly terminated by starburst
induced by major mergers in all environments.
