 abstract = "{We report a search for z = 7 Ly{$\alpha$} emitters (LAEs) using a
custom-made narrowband filter centered at 9755 {\AA}  with the
Suprime-Cam instrument installed at the Subaru telescope. We observed
two different fields and obtained two samples of seven LAEs, of which
four are robust in each field. We cover the luminosity range of
9.10$^{42}$-2.10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in comoving
volumes of \~{}4 {\times} 10$^{5}$ and 4.3 {\times} 10$^{5}$
Mpc$^{3}$. From this result, we derived possible z \~{} 7 Ly{$\alpha$}
luminosity functions for the full samples and for a subsample of four
objects in each field. We do not observe, in each case, any strong
evolution between the z = 6.5 and z \~{} 7 Ly{$\alpha$} luminosity functions.
Spectroscopic confirmation for these candidate samples is required to
establish a definitive measure of the luminosity function at z \~{} 7.

 abstract = "{To obtain basic data for adequate air circulation for promoting plant
growth in closed plant production modules in bioregenerative life
support systems in space, effects of air velocities ranging from 0.1 to
0.8 m s $^{-1}$ on photosynthesis in tomato seedlings canopies
were investigated under atmospheric CO $_{2}$ concentrations of
0.4 and 0.8 mmol mol $^{-1}$. The canopy of tomato seedlings on a
plug tray (0.4 {\times} 0.4 m $^{2}$) was set in a wind-tunnel-type
chamber (0.6 {\times} 0.4 {\times} 0.3 m $^{3}$) installed in a
semi-closed-type assimilation chamber (0.9 {\times} 0.5 {\times} 0.4 m
$^{3}$). The net photosynthetic rate in the plant canopy was
determined with the differences in CO $_{2}$ concentrations
between the inlet and outlet of the assimilation chamber multiplied by
the volumetric air exchange rate of the chamber. Photosynthetic photon
flux (PPF) on the plant canopy was kept at 0.25 mmol m $^{-2}$ s
$^{-1}$, air temperature at 23 {\deg}C and relative humidity at
55\%. The leaf area indices (LAIs) of the plant canopies were 0.6-2.5 and
plant heights were 0.05-0.2 m. The net photosynthetic rate of the plant
canopy increased with increasing air velocities inside plant canopies
and saturated at 0.2 m s $^{-1}$. The net photosynthetic rate at
the air velocity of 0.4 m s $^{-1}$ was 1.3 times that at 0.1 m s
$^{-1}$ under CO $_{2}$ concentrations of 0.4 and 0.8 mmol
mol $^{-1}$. The net photosynthetic rate under CO $_{2}$
concentrations of 0.8 mmol mol $^{-1}$ was 1.2 times that under
0.4 mmol mol $^{-1}$ at the air velocity ranging from 0.1 to 0.8 m
s $^{-1}$. The results confirmed the importance of controlling air
movement for enhancing the canopy photosynthesis under an elevated CO
$_{2}$ level as well as under a normal CO $_{2}$ level in
the closed plant production modules.

    title = "{Effects of air current speed on gas exchange in plant leaves and plant canopies}",
  journal = {Advances in Space Research},
     year = 2003,
   volume = 31,
    pages = {177-182},
 abstract = "{To obtain basic data on adequate air circulation to enhance plant growth
in a closed plant culture system in a controlled ecological life support
system (CELSS), an investigation was made of the effects of the air
current speed ranging from 0.01 to 1.0 m s$^{-1}$ on
photosynthesis and transpiration in sweetpotato leaves and
photosynthesis in tomato seedlings canopies. The gas exchange rates in
leaves and canopies were determined by using a chamber method with an
infrared gas analyzer. The net photosynthetic rate and the transpiration
rate increased significantly as the air current speeds increased from
0.01 to 0.2 m s$^{-1}$. The transpiration rate increased gradually
at air current speeds ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 m s$^{-1}$ while the
net photosynthetic rate was almost constant at air current speeds
ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 m s$^{-1}$. The increase in the net
photosynthetic and transpiration rates were strongly dependent on
decreased boundary-layer resistances against gas diffusion. The net
photosynthetic rate of the plant canopy was doubled by an increased air
current speed from 0.1 to 1.0 m s$^{-1}$ above the plant canopy.
The results demonstrate the importance of air movement around plants for
enhancing the gas exchange in the leaf, especially in plant canopies in
the CELSS.
