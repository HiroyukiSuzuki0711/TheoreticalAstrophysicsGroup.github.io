 abstract = "{We present diffuse Ly{$\alpha$} haloes (LAHs) identified in the composite
Subaru narrow-band images of 100-3600 Ly{$\alpha$} emitters (LAEs) at z =
2.2, 3.1, 3.7, 5.7, and 6.6. First, we carefully examine potential
artefacts mimicking LAHs that include a large-scale point-spread
function made by instrumental and atmospheric effects. Based on our
critical test with composite images of non-LAE samples whose
narrow-band-magnitude and source-size distributions are the same as our
LAE samples, we confirm that no artefacts can produce a diffuse extended
feature similar to our LAHs. After this test, we measure the
scalelengths of exponential profile for the LAHs estimated from our z =
2.2-6.6 LAE samples of L$_{Lyalpha}$ {\gsim} 2 {\times}
10$^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We obtain the scalelengths of
{\sime}5-10 kpc at z = 2.2-5.7, and find no evolution of scalelengths in
this redshift range beyond our measurement uncertainties. Combining this
result and the previously known UV-continuum size evolution, we infer
that the ratio of LAH to UV-continuum sizes is nearly constant at z =
2.2-5.7. The scalelength of our z = 6.6 LAH is larger than 5-10 kpc just
beyond the error bar, which is a hint that the scalelengths of LAHs
would increase from z = 5.7 to 6.6. If this increase is confirmed by
future large surveys with significant improvements of statistical and
systematical errors, this scalelength change at z {\gsim} 6 would be a
signature of increasing fraction of neutral hydrogen scattering
Ly{$\alpha$} photons, due to cosmic reionization.

(IS) absorption, and nebular lines and gas covering fraction for
Ly{$\alpha$} emitters (LAEs) at z \~{}= 2. We make a sample of 22 LAEs with a
large Ly{$\alpha$} equivalent width (EW) of {\gt}\~{} 50 {\AA} based on our
deep Keck/Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) observations, in
conjunction with spectroscopic data from the Subaru/Fiber Multi Object
Spectrograph program and the literature. We estimate the average
velocity offset of Ly{$\alpha$} from a systemic redshift determined with
nebular lines to be {$\Delta$}v $_{Lyalpha}$ = 234 {\plusmn} 9 km
s$^{-1}$. Using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we confirm the
previous claim of Hashimoto et al. that the average {$\Delta$}v
$_{Lyalpha}$ of LAEs is smaller than that of Lyman break
galaxies (LBGs). Our LRIS data successfully identify blueshifted
multiple IS absorption lines in the UV continua of four LAEs on an
individual basis. The average velocity offset of IS absorption lines
from a systemic redshift is {$\Delta$}v $_{IS}$ = 204 {\plusmn} 27 km
s$^{-1}$, indicating LAEs' gas outflow with a velocity
comparable to typical LBGs. Thus, the ratio  R\^{}Ly$\backslash$alpha \_IS $\backslash$equiv
$\backslash$Delta v\_Ly$\backslash$alpha /$\backslash$Delta v\_IS of LAEs is around unity, suggestive of
low impacts on Ly{$\alpha$} transmission by resonant scattering of neutral
hydrogen in the IS medium. We find an anti-correlation between Ly{$\alpha$}
EW and the covering fraction, f$_{c}$ , estimated from the depth
of absorption lines, where f$_{c}$ is an indicator of average
neutral hydrogen column density, N $_{H I }$. The results of our
study support the idea that N $_{H I }$ is a key quantity
determining Ly{$\alpha$} emissivity.

Ly{$\alpha$} emitters (LAEs) at z \~{} 2.2 that are observed with the Hubble
Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys and WFC3-IR during deep
extra-galactic legacy surveys. We confirm that the merger fraction and
the average ellipticity of LAE's stellar component are 10\%-30\% and
0.4-0.6, respectively, that are comparable with previous study results.
We successfully identify that some LAEs have a spatial offset between
Ly{$\alpha$} and stellar-continuum emission peaks,
{$\delta$}$_{Lyalpha}$, by \~{}2.5-4 kpc beyond our statistical
errors. To uncover the physical origin of strong Ly{$\alpha$} emission
found in LAEs, we investigate the Ly{$\alpha$} equivalent width (EW)
dependences of three structural parameters: merger fraction,
{$\delta$}$_{Lyalpha}$, and ellipticity of stellar distribution in
the range of EW(Ly{$\alpha$}) = 20-250 {\AA}. Contrary to expectations,
we find that the merger fraction does not significantly increase with
Ly{$\alpha$} EW. We reveal an anti-correlation between
{$\delta$}$_{Lyalpha}$ and EW(Ly{$\alpha$}) using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov
(K-S) test. There is a trend that the LAEs with a large Ly{$\alpha$} EW
have a small ellipticity. This is consistent with the recent theoretical
claims that Ly{$\alpha$} photons can more easily escape from face-on disks
having a small ellipticity, due to less inter-stellar gas along the line
of sight, although our K-S test indicates that this trend is not
statistically significant. Our results of Ly{$\alpha$}-EW dependence
generally support the idea that an H I column density is a key quantity

harbors an obscured type-2 active galactic nucleus (AGN). The presence
of gas outflows in this object is suggested by two marginal detections
of Fe II {$\lambda$}2587 absorption and Fe II* {$\lambda$}2613 emission lines
both of which are blueshifted at as large as 500-600 km

AGN or associated shock excitation rather than supernovae produced by
starbursts. The number density of O IIB 1-type giant blobs is estimated
to be \~{}5 {\times} 10$^{-6}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ at z \~{}

that the mass and the energy are accurately conserved for all the test

predictions and/or analytic solutions. The distribution function keeps
the property of positivity and remains non-oscillatory. The largest
simulations are run on 64$^{6}$ grids. The computation speed

 abstract = "{Based on a three-dimensional model of an early star-forming galaxy, we
explore the evolution of the sub-millimetre brightness. The model galaxy
is employed from an ultra-high-resolution chemodynamic simulation of a
primordial galaxy by Mori {\amp} Umemura, where the star formation rate
(SFR) is {\tilde}10 M$_{&sun;}$ yr$^{-1}$ at
t$_{age}${\lsim} 0.3 Gyr and several M$_{&sun;}$
yr$^{-1}$ at t$_{age}$ {\gt}0.3 Gyr. The former phase well
reproduces the observed properties of Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) and
the latter does Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). We solve the
three-dimensional radiative transfer in the clumpy interstellar media in
this model galaxy, taking the size distributions of dust grains into
account, and calculate the dust temperature as a function of galactic
evolutionary time. We find that the clumpiness of interstellar media
plays an important role for the sub-millimetre brightness. In the LAE
phase, dust grains are concentrated on clumpy star-forming regions that
are distributed all over the galaxy, and the grains can effectively
absorb ultraviolet (UV) radiation from stars. As a result, the dust is
heated up to T$_{dust}${\gsim}35 K. In the LBG phase, the
continuous supernovae drive dust grains far away from star-forming
regions. Then, the grains cannot absorb much radiation from stars, and
become a cold state close to the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
temperature. Consequently, the dust temperature decreases with the
evolutionary time, where the mass-weighted mean temperature is
T$_{dust}$= 26 K at t$_{age}$= 0.1 Gyr and T$_{dust}$=
21 K at t$_{age}$= 1.0 Gyr. By this analysis, it turns out that
the sub-millimetre brightness is higher in the LAE phase than that in
the LBG phase, although the dust-to-gas ratio increases monotonically as
a function of time. We derive the spectral energy distributions by
placing the model galaxy at a given redshift. The peak flux at 850 {$\mu$}
m is found to be S$_{850}${\tilde} 0.2-0.9 mJy if the model galaxy
is placed at 6 {\ge}z{\ge} 2. This means that Atacama Large
Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA) can detect an early star-forming
galaxy with SFR of {\tilde}10 M$_{&sun;}$ yr$^{-1}$ by less
than one hour integration with 16 antennas.

 abstract = "{We present two types of numerical prescriptions that accelerate the
radiative transfer calculation around point sources within a
three-dimensional Cartesian grid by using the oct-tree structure for the
distribution of radiation sources. In one prescription, distant
radiation sources are grouped as a bright extended source when the
group's angular size, {\thetas}$_{s}$, is smaller than a critical
value, {\thetas}$_{crit}$, and radiative transfer is solved on
supermeshes whose angular size is similar to that of the group of
sources. The supermesh structure is constructed by coarse-graining the
mesh structure. With this method, the computational time scales with
N$_{m}$log (N$_{m}$)log (N$_{s}$), where N$_{m}$
and N$_{s}$ are the number of meshes and that of radiation
sources, respectively. While this method is very efficient, it
inevitably overestimates the optical depth when a group of sources acts
as an extended powerful radiation source and affects distant meshes. In
the other prescription, a distant group of sources is treated as a
bright point source ignoring the spatial extent of the group, and the
radiative transfer is solved on the meshes rather than the supermeshes.
This prescription is simply a grid-based version of START by Hasegawa
{\amp} Umemura and yields better results in general with slightly more
computational cost [?] than the supermesh prescription. Our methods can
easily be implemented to any grid-based hydrodynamic codes and are well
suited to adaptive mesh refinement methods.

 abstract = "{In the last decade, numerous Lyman {$\alpha$} (Ly{$\alpha$}) emitters (LAEs)
have been discovered with narrow-band filters at various redshifts.
Recently, multiwavelength observations of LAEs have been performed and
revealed that while many LAEs appear to be young and less massive, a
noticeable fraction of LAEs possess much older populations of stars and
larger stellar mass. How these two classes of LAEs are concordant with
the hierarchical galaxy formation scenario has not been understood
clearly so far. In this paper, we model LAEs by three-dimensional
cosmological simulations of dark halo merger in a {$\Lambda$} cold dark
matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) universe. As a result, it is shown that the age of
simulated LAEs can spread over a wide range from 2 {\times}
10$^{6}$ to 9 {\times} 10$^{8}$yr. Furthermore, we find that
there are two types of LAEs, in one of which the young half-mass age is
comparable to the mean age of stellar component, and in the other of
which the young half-mass age is appreciably shorter than the mean age.
We define the former as Type 1 LAEs and the latter as Type 2 LAEs. A
Type 1 LAE corresponds to early starburst in a young galaxy, whereas a
Type 2 LAE does to delayed starburst in an evolved galaxy, as a
consequence of delayed accretion of a subhalo on to a larger parent
halo. Thus, the same halo can experience a Type 2 LAE phase as well as a
Type 1 LAE phase in the merger history. Type 1 LAEs are expected to be
younger than 1.5 {\times} 10$^{8}$yr, less dusty and less massive
with stellar mass M$_{star}$ {\lt}\~{} 5 {\times}
10$^{8}$M$_{solar}$, while Type 2 LAEs are older than 1.5
{\times} 10$^{8}$yr, even dustier and as massive as
M$_{star}$ \~{} 5 {\times} 10$^{8}$-3 {\times}
10$^{10}$M$_{solar}$. The fraction of Type 2s in all LAEs is
a function of redshift, which is less than 2 per cent at z {\gt}\~{} 4.5,
\~{}30 per cent at redshift z = 3.1 and \~{}70 per cent at z = 2. Type 2 LAEs
can be discriminated clearly from Type 1s in two-colour diagrams of z' -
H versus J - K. We find that the brightness distribution of Ly{$\alpha$} in
Type 2 LAEs is more extended than the main stellar component, in
contrast to Type 1 LAEs. This is not only because delayed starbursts
tend to occur in the outskirts of a parent galaxy, but also because
Ly{$\alpha$} photons are effectively absorbed by dust in an evolved galaxy.
Hence, the extent of Ly{$\alpha$} emission may be an additional measure to
distinguish Type 2 LAEs from Type 1 LAEs. The sizes of Type 2 LAEs range
from a few tens to a few hundreds kpc. At lower redshifts, the number of
more extended, older Type 2 LAEs increases. Furthermore, it is
anticipated that the amplitude of angular correlation function for Type
2 LAEs is significantly higher than that for Type 1 LAEs, but comparable
to that for Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). This implies that LBGs with
strong Ly{$\alpha$} line may include Type 2 LAEs.

follow gas dynamics and radiative transfer (RT) self-consistently is key

alternative validation procedure is to compare different methods against
each other on common problems, in order to assess the robustness of the
results and establish a range of validity for the methods. Previously,
we presented such a comparison for a set of pure RT tests (i.e. for
fixed, non-evolving density fields). This is the second paper of the
Cosmological Radiative Transfer Comparison Project, in which we compare
nine independent RT codes directly coupled to gas dynamics on three
relatively simple astrophysical hydrodynamics problems: (i) the
expansion of an HII region in a uniform medium, (ii) an ionization front
in a 1/r$^{2}$ density profile with a flat core and (iii) the
photoevaporation of a uniform dense clump. Results show a broad
agreement between the different methods and no big failures, indicating
that the participating codes have reached a certain level of maturity
and reliability. However, many details still do differ, and virtually
every code has showed some shortcomings and has disagreed, in one
respect or another, with the majority of the results. This underscores
the fact that no method is universal and all require careful testing of
the particular features which are most relevant to the specific problem
at hand.

galaxies by solving the three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer. The
model galaxy is employed from an ultra-high-resolution chemodynamic
simulation of a primordial galaxy by Mori {\amp} Umemura, which well
reproduces the observed properties of LAEs and LBGs. The total mass of
model galaxy is 10$^{11}$M$_{solar}$. We solve not only
photoionization but also collisional ionization by shocks. In addition,
according to the chemical enrichment, we incorporate the effect of dust
extinction, taking the size distributions of dust into account. As a
result, we find that dust extinction reduces the escape fractions by a
factor of 1.5-8.5 in the LAE phase and by a factor of 2.5-11 in the LBG
phase, while the collisional ionization by shocks increases the escape
fractions by a factor of \~{}2. The resultant escape fractions are
0.07-0.47 in the LAE phase and 0.06-0.17 in the LBG phase. These results
are well concordant with the recent estimations derived from the flux
density ratio at 1500 to 900 {\AA} of LAEs and LBGs. Combining the
resultant escape fractions with the luminosity functions of LAEs and
LBGs, we find that high-z LAEs and LBGs can ionize the IGM at z = 3-5.
However, ionizing radiation from LAEs as well as LBGs falls short of
ionizing the IGM at z {\gt} 6. That implies that additional ionization
sources may be required at z {\gt} 6.

To properly treat RHD feedback, we perform three-dimensional RHD
simulations incorporating the radiative transfer of ionizing photons as
well as H$_{2}$ dissociating photons from a preformed star. A
collapsing gas cloud is settled at a given distance from a 120 M
$_{sun}$ Pop III star, and the evolution of the cloud is pursued
including RHD feedback. We derive the threshold density depending on the
distance, above which the cloud can keep collapsing owing to the
shielding of H$_{2}$ dissociating radiation. We find that an
H$_{2}$ shell formed ahead of an ionizing front works effectively
to shield the H$_{2}$ dissociating radiation, leading to the
positive feedback for the secondary Pop III star formation. Also, near
the threshold density, the envelope of gas cloud is stripped
significantly by a shock associated with an ionizing front. By comparing
the mass accretion timescale with the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale, we
estimate the mass of secondary Pop III stars. It turns out that the
stripping by a shock can reduce the mass of secondary Pop III stars down
to {\ap}20 M $_{sun}$.

the ultraviolet (UV) background radiation effectively works so as to
produce compact star clusters. Recent observations on the age
distributions of GCs indicate that many GCs formed even after the cosmic
reionization epoch. This implies that a significant fraction of GCs
formed in UV background radiation fields. Also, the star formation in an
early-generation of subgalactic objects may be affected by strong UV
radiation from pre-formed massive stars, e.g. Population III stars.
Here, we explore the formation of GCs in UV radiation fields. For this
purpose, we calculate baryon and dark matter (DM) dynamics in spherical
symmetry, incorporating the self-shielding effects by solving the
radiative transfer of UV radiation. In addition, we prescribe the star
formation in cooled gas components and pursue the dynamics of formed
stars. As a result, we find that the evolution of subgalactic objects in
UV background radiation is separated into three types: (i) prompt star
formation, where less massive clouds
(\~{}10$^{5-8}$M$_{solar}$) are promptly self-shielded and
undergo star formation, (ii) delayed star formation, where photoionized
massive clouds ({\gt}\~{}10$^{8}$M$_{solar}$) collapse despite
high thermal pressure and are eventually self-shielded to form stars in
a delayed fashion, and (iii) supersonic infall, where photoionized less
massive clouds (\~{}10$^{5-8}$M$_{solar}$) contract with
supersonic infall velocity and are self-shielded when a compact core
forms. In particular, the type (iii) is a novel type found in the
present simulations, and eventually produces a very compact star
cluster. The resultant mass-to-light ratios, half-mass radii and
velocity dispersions for the three types are compared to the
observations of GCs, dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) and ultracompact dwarfs
(UCDs). It turns out that the properties of star clusters resulting from
supersonic infall match well with those of observed GCs, whereas the
other two types are distinct from GCs. Hence, we conclude that
supersonic infall in a UV background is a promising mechanism to form
GCs.

binary that is expected to form in a portion of Population III stars

binary system, a more massive star can result in the formation of a
black hole (BH) and a surrounding accretion disc. Such BH accretion
could be a significant source of the cosmic reionization in the early
Universe. However, a less massive companion star evolves belatedly and
eventually undergoes a SN explosion, so that the accretion disc around a
BH might be blown off in a lifetime of companion star. In this paper, we
explore the dynamical impact of a SN explosion on an accretion disc
around a massive BH, and elucidate whether the BH accretion disc is
totally demolished or not. For the purpose, we perform three-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations of a very massive binary system, where we
assume a BH of 10$^{3}$M$_{solar}$ that results from a
direct collapse of a very massive star and a companion star of
100M$_{solar}$ that undergoes a SN explosion. We calculate the
remaining mass of a BH accretion disc as a function of time. As a
result, it is found that a significant portion of gas disc can survive
through three-dimensional geometrical effects even after the SN
explosion of a companion star. Even if the SN explosion energy is higher
by two orders of magnitude than the binding energy of gas disc, about a
half of disc can be left over. The results imply that the Population III
BH accretion disc can be a long-lived luminous source, and therefore
could be an important ionizing source in the early Universe.

The structure is extended over more than 50 Mpc at redshift z = 3.1, and

distributions appear to be incompatible with the standard biased galaxy
formation scenario in the CDM cosmology. In this Letter, by considering
the possibility that LAEs are short-lived events, we attempt to build up
the picture of LAEs concordant with the CDM cosmology. We find that if
the lifetime of LAEs is as short as , the distributions of simulated
galaxies successfully match the extension and morphology of large-scale

function. This result implies that LAEs at z = 3.1 do not necessarily
reside in high density peaks, but tends to be located in less dense

two consist of 539 and 240 LBGs at z\~{}5 down to z'=26.05 selected with
two kinds of two-color diagram: V-i' versus i'-z' and R-i' versus i'-z'.
The adopted selection criteria are proved to be fairly reliable by
spectroscopic observations. We derive the luminosity functions of the
LBGs at rest-frame ultraviolet wavelengths down to M$_{UV}$=-19.2
at z\~{}4 and M$_{UV}$=-20.3 at z\~{}5. We find clear evolution of the
luminosity function over the redshift range 0{\lt}=z{\lt}=6, which is
accounted for solely by a change in the characteristic magnitude
M$^{*}$. We examine the evolution of the cosmic star formation
rate (SFR) density and its luminosity dependence over 0{\lt}=z{\lt}\~{}6. The
SFR density contributed from brighter galaxies is found to change more
drastically with cosmic time. The contribution from brighter galaxies
has a sharp peak around z=3-4, while that from fainter galaxies evolves
relatively mildly with a broad peak at earlier epochs. Combining the
observed SFR density with the standard cold dark matter model, we
compute the cosmic SFR per unit baryon mass in dark halos, that is, the
specific SFR. The specific SFR is found to scale with redshift as
(1+z)$^{3}$ up to z\~{}4, implying that the efficiency of star
formation is on average higher at higher redshift in proportion to the
cooling rate within dark halos, while this is not simply the case at
z{\gt}\~{}4.

in its final form. The bubble structures of gas revealed in our
simulation (for times of less than 3 {\times} 10$^{8}$years)
resemble closely high-redshift Lyman-{$\alpha$} emitters. After
10$^{9}$years, these bodies are dominated by stellar continuum
radiation and then resemble the Lyman break galaxies, which are
high-redshift star-forming galaxies. At this point, the abundance of
elements heavier than helium (`metallicity') appears to be solar. After
1.3 {\times} 10$^{10}$years, these galaxies resemble present-day
ellipticals.

 abstract = "{We explored the clustering properties of Lyman break galaxies at z=4 and
5 with an angular two-point correlation function on the basis of the
very deep and wide Subaru Deep Field data. We confirmed the previous
result that the clustering strength of LBGs depends on the UV luminosity
in the sense that brighter LBGs are more strongly clustered. In
addition, we found an apparent dependence of the correlation function
slope on UV luminosity for LBGs at both z=4 and 5. More luminous LBGs
have a steeper correlation function. The bias parameter was found to be
a scale-dependent function for bright LBGs, whereas it appears to be
almost scale-independent for faint LBGs. Luminous LBGs have a higher
bias at smaller angular scales, which decreases as the scale increases.
To compare these observational results, we constructed numerical mock
LBG catalogs based on a semianalytic model of hierarchical clustering
combined with high-resolution N-body simulation, carefully mimicking the
observational selection effects. The luminosity functions and the
overall correlation functions for LBGs at z=4 and 5 predicted by this
mock catalog were found to be almost consistent with the observation.
The observed dependence of the clustering on UV luminosity was not
reproduced by the model, unless subsamples of distinct halo mass were
considered. That is, LBGs belonging to more massive dark halos had
steeper and larger amplitude correlation functions. With this model, we
found that LBG multiplicity in massive dark halos amplifies the
clustering strength at small scales, which steepens the correlation
function. The hierarchical clustering model could therefore be
reconciled with the observed luminosity dependence of the correlation
function if there is a tight correlation between UV luminosity and halo
mass. Our finding that the slope of the correlation function depends on
luminosity could be an indication that massive dark halos hosted
multiple bright LBGs.

compare the black hole (BH) mass, the bulge luminosity, and the
far-infrared luminosity among type I ULIRGs, QSOs, and elliptical
galaxies. As a result, we find the following results: (1) The type I
ULIRGs have systematically smaller BH masses in spite of the comparable
bulge luminosity relative to QSOs and elliptical galaxies. (2) The
far-infrared luminosity of most type I ULIRGs is larger than the
Eddington luminosity. We show that the above results do not change
significantly for three type I ULIRGs for which we can estimate the
visual extinction from the column density. Also, for all eight type I
ULIRGs, we investigate the effect of uncertainties of BH mass
measurements and our sample bias to make sure that our results are not
altered even if we consider the above two effects. In addition, Anabuki
recently revealed that their X-ray properties are similar to those of
the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. These would indicate that active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) with a high mass accretion rate exist in type I
ULIRGs. On the basis of all of these findings, we conclude that it would
be a natural interpretation that type I ULIRGs are the early phase of BH
growth, namely, the missing link between ULIRGs and QSOs. Moreover, by
comparing our results with a theoretical model of a coevolution scenario
of a QSO BH and a galactic bulge, we show clearly that this explanation
could be valid.

radiation drag extracts angular momentum from interstellar gas and thus
allows the gas to accrete onto the cluster center. By incorporating the
realistic chemical evolution of globular clusters, we scrutinize the
efficiency of the radiation drag to assess the total accreted mass. As a
result, we find that if a globular cluster is more massive than
\~{}6{\times}10$^{6}$ M$_{solar}$ in the present-day stellar
component, a massive BH with {\gt}260 M$_{solar}$ can form within
it. But the BH-to-cluster mass ratio is considerably smaller than the
BH-to-bulge mass ratio (\~{}10$^{-3}$) found in galactic bulges. The
results are not sensitive to the assumed stellar initial mass function
and star formation rate in the cluster, as long as the resulting
color-magnitude relation, metallicity, and mass-to-luminosity ratio
satisfy those observed in globular clusters. Hence, the putative linear
relation between BH mass and bulge mass

globular cluster systems. In the present regime, we discuss the BH
formation in M15, G1, {$\omega$} Cen, the M33 nucleus, and the compact

For this purpose, the dynamical evolution of gas clouds is pursued,
including the effects of radiation forces by an AGN as well as a
starburst. Here we solve the radiative transfer equations for clouds,
taking into consideration the growth of clouds by inelastic cloud-cloud
collisions and the resultant change in optical depth. As a result, if
the starburst is more luminous than the AGN, gas clouds are distributed
extensively above the galactic disk with the assistance of radiation
pressure from the starburst. The total covering factor of gas clouds
reaches a maximum of about 20\%. After several 10$^{7}$ yr, gas
clouds with larger optical depth form by cloud-cloud collisions;
thereafter the clouds fall back as a result of weakened radiation
pressure. The larger clouds undergo runaway growth and are eventually
distributed around the equatorial plane on the inner sides of
circumnuclear starburst regions. These clouds have an optical depth of
several tens. The result is qualitatively consistent with the putative
tendency that Seyfert 2 galaxies appear more frequently associated with
starbursts than Seyfert 1 galaxies. On the other hand, if the AGN
luminosity overwhelms that of the starburst, almost all clouds are
ejected from the galaxy as a result of the radiation pressure from the
AGN, resulting in the formation of a quasar-like object. The origin of
obscuration of AGNs is discussed with relevant observations.

The collapse of a rotating cylinder is simulated with a

systems by scaling with the initial density. We find that if the initial
angular momentum is as small as {$\beta$}\~{}0.1, where {$\beta$} is the ratio of
centrifugal force to pressure force and is of the order of 10\%, then the
runaway collapse of the cloud stops to form a rotationally supported
disk. After the accretion of the envelope, the disk undergoes a ring
instability, eventually fragmenting into a binary. If the initial
angular momentum is relatively large, a bar-type instability arises,
resulting in the collapse into a single star through rapid angular
momentum transfer. The present results show that a significant fraction
of Population III stars are expected to form in binary systems, even if
they are quite massive or less massive. The cosmological implications of
Population III binaries are briefly discussed.

are quite similar to the structure predicted in the present simulation.
Furthermore, the result demonstrates that LABs are representative of
evolving primordial galaxies; they could hold direct information on the
early chemical enrichment of galaxies, contrary to present-day galaxies
that have undergone intense recycling of interstellar matter, thus
erasing most of the early chemical history. It turns out that the metal
mixing proceeds in a very inhomogeneous fashion, so that there appears a
large spread of metallicity, that is, [Fe/H]\~{}0 to-5 or [O/H]\~{}1 to-4.
Hence, the early galactic chemical evolution may have proceeded in a

region is defined as a spherical dense molecular gas cloud with a

initial slow expansion of a weak D-type ionization front near the
center, followed by rapid propagation of an R-type front throughout the
outer gas envelope. We find that the transition between the two front
types is indeed a critical condition for the complete ionization of
halos of cosmological interest. In small-mass ({\lt}\~{}10$^{6}$
M$_{solar}$) halos, the transition takes place within a few
10$^{5}$ yr, yielding high escape fractions ({\gt}80\%) of both

region is confined well inside the virial radius, and the escape
fractions are essentially zero. We derive an analytic formula that
reproduces well the results of our simulations for the critical halo

Local Group than dwarf galaxies. In this Letter, as a potential
mechanism for solving this problem, we consider the feedback effects of
early reionization on the formation of small-scale structures. For this

As a result, it is found that the early reionization is devastating for

almost all gas is photoevaporated in more than 95\% of low-mass systems.

supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in disk galaxies appear to be smaller
than those in elliptigalaxies in the same luminosity range. We consider
the formation of SMBHs by radiation drag (the Poynting-Robertson
effect), which extracts angular momentum from interstellar matter and
thereby drives the mass accretion onto a galactic center. In particular,
we quantitatively scrutinize the efficiency of radiation drag in a
galaxy composed of bulge and disk, and we elucidate the relation between
the final mass of SMBH and the bulge-to-disk ratio of the galaxy. As a
result, it is found that the BH-to-galaxy mass ratio,
M$_{BH}$/M$_{galaxy}$, decreases with a smaller
bulge-to-disk ratio, because of the effects of geometridilution and
opacity, and is reduced maximally by 2 orders of magnitude, resulting in
M$_{BH}$/M$_{galaxy}$\~{}10$^{-5}$. In contrast, if only
the bulge components in galaxies are focused, the BH-to-bulge mass ratio
becomes M$_{BH}$/M$_{bulge}$\~{}10$^{-3}$, which is
similar to that found in elliptigalaxies. Thus, it turns out that the
mass of an SMBH primarily correlates with a bulge, not with a disk,
consistent with observational data.

chemistry of primordial gas including H$_{2}$ molecules is also
incorporated. Attention is concentrated on radiative transfer effects on
the UVB for the formation of subgalactic objects with
T$_{vir}${\lt}\~{}10$^{4}$ K. We consider a reionization model
with z$_{reion}$\~{}7 and also the earlier reionization model
(z$_{reion}$\~{}17) inferred by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
Probe (WMAP). We find that star formation is suppressed appreciably by
UVB, but baryons at high-density peaks are self-shielded even during the
reionization, forming some amount of stars eventually. In that sense,
the photoevaporation for subgalactic systems is not as perfect as argued
by one-dimensional spherical calculations. The final stellar fraction
depends on the collapse epoch and the mass of the system, almost
regardless of the reionization epoch. For instance, a few tenths of the
formed stars are born after the cosmic reionization in the
z$_{reion}$\~{}7 model, while more than 90\% of the stars are born
after the reionization in the WMAP reionization model. Thus, the effects
of UVB feedback on the substructure problem with a cold dark matter
(CDM) scenario should be evaluated with careful treatment of the
radiative transfer. The star clusters formed at high-density peaks
coalesce with each other in a dissipationless fashion in a dark matter
potential, as a resultant forming a spheroidal system. As a result,
these low-mass galaxies have large mass-to-light ratios, such as
observed in dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Local Group.

the very early epoch of the galaxy formation, the metallicity is still
lower than that of LBGs. However, the analysis presented here

for this crisis to discriminate whether the expected number of CDM

quasars that are gravitationally lensed by a foreground galaxy. A
substructure around a lensing galaxy may superposed on one of the lensed

should occur in the image behind the substructure, and additional
multiple images are created. From our estimations, the separation and

Furthermore, we evaluate that the optical depth for such events is sim
0.1. Consequently, future fine-resolution imaging and/or high-speed

(SED), depends strongly on the inclination of the system i, whereas the
peak flux is insensitive to i. Based on this result, we introduce a
novel indicator f$_{L}$, which is the ratio of L$_{SED}$ to
the peak flux, as a good measure for the inclination. By using
f$_{L}$, we can determine the inclination regardless of the other
physical parameters. The inclination would be determined by
f$_{L}$ within an accuracy of +/-5{\deg} if the opening angle of
bipolar outflows is specified by any other procedure. Since this
spectrophotometric method is easier than a geometrical method or a full
SED fitting method, it could be a powerful tool for investigating the
features of protostars statistically with observational data that will
be provided by future missions, such as SIRTF, Astro-F, and ALMA.

As a result, it is found that after a galactic wind epoch, the
luminosity is shifted from the host-dominant phase to the active
galactic nucleus-dominant phase (QSO phase) in the timescale of a few
10$^{8}$ yr. The former phase corresponds to the early stage of a
growing BH and can be regarded as a ``proto-QSO'' phase. It has
observable characteristic properties as follows: (1) The broad emission
lines are narrower than those of ordinary QSOs and are typically less
than 1500 km s$^{-1}$. (2) The BH-to-bulge mass ratio,
M$_{BH}$/M$_{bulge}$, is in the range of 10$^{-5.3}$
to 10$^{-3.9}$. (3) Host galaxies are bluer than QSO hosts, by
about 0.5 mag in the colors B-V at the rest bands and V-K at the
observed bands, with assumed galaxy formation redshifts of
z$_{f}$=3-5. (4) The metallicity of gas in the galactic nuclei is
\~{}8 Z$_{solar}$ and that of stars weighted by the host luminosity
is \~{}3 Z$_{solar}$. (5) The central massive BH (\~{}=10$^{7}$
M$_{solar}$) is surrounded by a massive dusty disk
({\gt}10$^{8}$ M$_{solar}$), which may obscure the nucleus in
the edge-on view and make a type 2 nucleus. By comparing these
predictions with recent observations, radio galaxies are a possible
candidate for proto-QSOs. Also, it is anticipated that the proto-QSO
phase is preceded by an optically thick phase, which may correspond to
ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). In this phase,
M$_{BH}$/M$_{bulge}$ is predicted to be much less than
10$^{-3}$ and to grow with metallicity. Moreover, as precursors of
ULIRGs, optically thin star-forming galaxies are predicted. These may be
in the assembly phase of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) or Ly{$\alpha$}
emitters.

effective temperature profile since it neglects time delay between
energy generation deeper inside the disk and energy release at the

below L\~{}L$_{E}$, while they appear above \~{}3L$_{E}$ according
to the slim disk. Through the photon-trapping effects, the luminosity is
reduced and the effective temperature profile becomes flatter than
r$^{-3/4}$, as in the standard disk. In the case in which the
viscous heating is effective only around the equatorial plane, the
luminosity is kept around the Eddington luminosity even at a very large
mass accretion rate, M{\gt}{\gt}L$_{E}$/c$^{2}$. The effective
temperature profile is almost flat, and the maximum temperature
decreases in accordance with a rise in the mass accretion rate. Thus,
the most luminous radius shifts to the outer region when

which the energy is dissipated equally at any height, the resultant
luminosity is somewhat larger than in the former case, but the energy
conversion still efficiently decreases with an increase of the mass
accretion rate as well. The most luminous radius stays around the inner
edge of the disk in the latter case. Hence, the effective temperature

rates, as is the spectral shape. Future observations of high

from the radiation fields in a galactic bulge in order to examine the
possibility that the radiation drag could be an effective mechanism to
extract angular momentum in a spheroidal system like a bulge and allow
plenty of gas to accrete on to the galactic centre. For this purpose, we
numerically solve the relativistic radiation hydrodynamical equation
coupled with accurate radiative transfer, and quantitatively assess the
radiation drag efficiency. As a result, we find that in an optically
thick regime the radiation drag efficiency is sensitively dependent on
the density distributions of the interstellar medium (ISM). The
efficiency drops according to {$\tau$}T-2 in an optically thick uniform
ISM, where {$\tau$}$_{T}$ is the total optical depth of the dusty
ISM, whereas the efficiency remains almost constant at a high level if
the ISM is clumpy. Hence, if bulge formation begins with a star
formation event in a clumpy ISM, the radiation drag will effectively
work to remove the angular momentum and the accreted gas may form a
supermassive black hole. As a natural consequence, this mechanism
reproduces a putative linear relation between the mass of a supermassive
black hole and the mass of a galactic bulge, although further detailed
modelling for stellar evolution is required for a more precise

NIR/optical/X-ray bands for 1.3 {\lt}\~{} z {\lt}\~{} 3.5 is discussed based on
realistic QSO spectra. The accretion-disk theory predicts that although
the QSO luminosities only depend on the mass-accretion rate, dot$\{$M$\}$, the
QSO spectra have dependence on the black-hole mass, M$_{BH}$, as
well. The smaller is M$_{BH}$ and/or the larger is dot$\{$M$\}$, the
harder does the QSO NIR/optical/UV spectrum become. We modeled the disk
spectra which can reproduce these features, and calculated the LFs for a
redshift of z \~{} 3 with the assumption of new-born QSOs shining at the
Eddington luminosity. The main results are: (i) the LFs observed at
optical and X-ray bands can be simultaneously reproduced. (ii) LFs in
the optical and X-ray bands are not sensitive to M$_{BH}$, while
LFs at the NIR bands are; about a one order of magnitude difference is
expected in the volume number densities at L$_{I,J}$ \~{}
10$^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ between the case that all QSOs would
have the same spectral shape as that of M$_{BH}$ =
10$^{9}$Msolar and the case with M$_{BH}$ = 10$^{11}$
Msolar. (iii) The resultant LFs at NIR are dominated by black holes at
L$_{I,J}$ {\lt}\~{} 10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and by
10$^{11}$Msolar black holes at L$_{I,J}$ {\gt}\~{}
10$^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Future infrared observations from
space (e.g. NGST) will probe the cosmological evolution of black-hole
masses. For a redshift of z {\lt} 3, on the other hand, the observed
optical/X-ray LFs can be fitted if the initial QSO luminosity,
L$_{0}$, is below the Eddington luminosity, L$_{Edd}$.
Interestingly, the best-fitted values of l {\equiv}
L$_{0}$/L$_{Edd}$ are different in the B- and X-ray bands;
l$_{B}$ {\ap} 2.5 l$_{x}$. The reason for this discrepancy is
briefly discussed.

starburst around an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We concentrate our
attention on the role of the radiation force of a starburst as well as
an AGN, in which the effects of the optical depth of dusty gas are taken
into consideration. First, we solve the hydrostatic equations in
spherical symmetry coupled with the frequency-dependent radiative
processes to demonstrate that a geometrically thin, optically thick wall
forms because of the radiation pressure of a circumnuclear starburst.
Next, in two-dimensional axisymmetric space, we analyze the
configuration and the stability of geometrically thin walls that are
balanced between radiation pressure and gravity. As a result, it is
shown that the radiation force of the circumnuclear starburst works to
stabilize optically thick walls surrounding the nucleus. In the case of
a brighter starburst with a fainter AGN (e.g.,
L$_{SB}$/M$_{SB}${\gt}\~{}10
[L$_{solar}$/M$_{solar}$] and
L$_{AGN}${\lt}\~{}10$^{11}$ L$_{solar}$), there form
double walls, the inner one of which is located between the nucleus and
the circumnuclear starburst and the outer one of which enshrouds both
the starburst regions and the nucleus. The total extinction of both
walls turns out to be larger for a brighter starburst, which is
A$_{V}$\~{}10 mag for
L$_{SB}$/M$_{SB}${\gt}\~{}10$^{2}$
(L$_{solar}$/M$_{solar}$). As a consequence, double walls
could heavily obscure the nucleus to make this a type 2 AGN. The outer
wall may provide an explanation for the recent indications for
large-scale obscuring materials in Seyfert 2 galaxies. Also, it is
predicted that the AGN type is time-dependent according to the stellar
evolution in the starburst, which shifts from type 2 to type 1 in
several times 10$^{7}$ yr owing to the disappearance of walls. In
contrast, if the AGN itself is much brighter than the starburst, as a
quasar is, then neither wall forms regardless of the starburst activity,
and the nucleus is likely to be identified as type 1. To conclude, the
radiatively supported gas walls could be responsible for the putative
correlation between AGN type and the starbursts, whereby Seyfert 2
galaxies are more frequently associated with circumnuclear starbursts
than type 1 galaxies, whereas quasars are mostly observed as type 1 AGNs
regardless of the star-forming activity in the host galaxies.

transfer effects are still prominent considerably after the percolation
epoch, in which patchy ionized regions connect with each other. In other
words, owing to the collective opacity, the Universe does not become
perfectly transparent against ionizing radiation even though strongly
self-shielded regions disappear. It turns out that the inhomogeneity of
the medium enhances the opacity effects and delays the end of
reionization. Owing to such radiative transfer effects, the reionization
in an inhomogeneous universe proceeds fairly slowly, in contrast to the
prompt reionization in a homogeneous universe, and as a result the
surface of reionization is not so sharply edged, but highly uneven. As a
signature of the uneven surface of reionization, the cosmic IR
background (CIB) radiation, which is produced by Ly{$\alpha$} photons
resulting from radiative recombination, could exhibit strong
anisotropies, reflecting the amplitude of density fluctuations at the
reionization era. The predicted CIB intensity lies on a level of
possible detection by forthcoming IR space telescope facilities.

explored using one- and two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations
coupled with the nonequilibrium processes of hydrogen molecule
formation. The cloud evolution is computed from the initial central
density n$_{c}$=10-10$^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$. The simulations
show that depending on the initial density, there are two occasions for
the fragmentation of primordial filaments. If a filament has relatively
low initial density such as n$_{c}${\lt}\~{}10$^{5}$
cm$^{-3}$, the radial contraction is slow as a result of less
effective H$_{2}$ cooling and appreciably decelerates at densities
higher than a critical density, where LTE populations are achieved for
the rotational levels of H$_{2}$ molecules and the cooling
timescale becomes accordingly longer than the free-fall timescale. This
filament tends to fragment into dense clumps before the central density
reaches 10$^{8}$-10$^{9}$ cm$^{-3}$, where
H$_{2}$ cooling by three-body reactions is effective and the
fragment mass is more massive than some tens of M$_{solar}$. In
contrast, if a filament is initially as dense as
n$_{c}${\gt}\~{}10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$, the more effective
H$_{2}$ cooling with the help of three-body reactions allows the
filament to contract up to n\~{}10$^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$. After the
density reaches n\~{}10$^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$, the filament becomes
optically thick to H$_{2}$ lines and the radial contraction
subsequently almost stops. At this final hydrostatic stage, the fragment
mass is lowered down to \~{}1 M$_{solar}$ because of the high density
of the filament. The dependence of the fragment mass upon the initial
density could be translated into the dependence on the local amplitude
of random Gaussian density fields or the epoch of the collapse of a
parent cloud. Hence, it is predicted that the initial mass function of
Population III stars is likely to be bimodal with peaks of
\~{}10$^{2}$ and \~{}1 M$_{solar}$, where the relative heights
could be a function of the collapse epoch. Implications for the metal
enrichment by Population III stars at high redshifts and baryonic dark
