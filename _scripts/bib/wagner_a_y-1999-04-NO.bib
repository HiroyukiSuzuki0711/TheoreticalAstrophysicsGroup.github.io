 abstract = "{We show, using global three-dimensional grid-based hydrodynamical
simulations, that ultrafast outflows (UFOs) from active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) result in considerable feedback of energy and momentum into the
interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy. The AGN wind interacts
strongly with the inhomogeneous, two-phase ISM consisting of dense
clouds embedded in a tenuous, hot, hydrostatic medium. The outflow
floods through the intercloud channels, sweeps up the hot ISM, and
ablates and disperses the dense clouds. The momentum of the UFO is
primarily transferred to the dense clouds via the ram pressure in the
channel flow, and the wind-blown bubble evolves in the energy-driven
regime. Any dependence on UFO opening angle disappears after the first
interaction with obstructing clouds. On kpc scales, therefore, feedback
by UFOs operates similarly to feedback by relativistic AGN jets.
Negative feedback is significantly stronger if clouds are distributed
spherically rather than in a disk. In the latter case, the turbulent
backflow of the wind drives mass inflow toward the central black hole.
Considering the common occurrence of UFOs in AGNs, they are likely to be
important in the cosmological feedback cycles of galaxy formation.

 abstract = "{We examine the detailed physics of the feedback mechanism by
relativistic active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets interacting with a
two-phase fractal interstellar medium (ISM) in the kpc-scale core of
galaxies using 29 three-dimensional grid-based hydrodynamical
simulations. The feedback efficiency, as measured by the amount of cloud
dispersal generated by the jet-ISM interactions, is sensitive to the
maximum size of clouds in the fractal cloud distribution but not to
their volume filling factor. Feedback ceases to be efficient for
Eddington ratios P $_{jet}$/L $_{edd}$ {\lt}\~{}
10$^{-4}$, although systems with large cloud complexes {\gt}\~{} 50 pc
require jets of Eddington ratio in excess of 10$^{-2}$ to disperse
the clouds appreciably. Based on measurements of the bubble expansion
rates in our simulations, we argue that sub-grid AGN prescriptions
resulting in negative feedback in cosmological simulations without a
multi-phase treatment of the ISM are good approximations if the volume
filling factor of warm-phase material is less than 0.1 and the cloud
complexes are smaller than \~{}25 pc. We find that the acceleration of the
dense embedded clouds is provided by the ram pressure of the
high-velocity flow through the porous channels of the warm phase, flow
that has fully entrained the shocked hot-phase gas it has swept up, and
is additionally mass loaded by ablated cloud material. This mechanism
transfers 10\% to 40\% of the jet energy to the cold and warm gas,
accelerating it within a few 10 to 100 Myr to velocities that match
those observed in a range of high- and low-redshift radio galaxies
hosting powerful radio jets.

 abstract = "{Over cosmic time, galaxies grow through the hierarchical merging of
smaller galaxies. However, the bright region of the galaxy luminosity
function is incompatible with the simplest version of hierarchical
merging, and it is believed that feedback from the central black hole in
the host galaxies reduces the number of bright galaxies and regulates
the co-evolution of the black hole and host galaxy. Numerous simulations
of galaxy evolution have attempted to include the physical effects of
such feedback with a resolution usually exceeding a kiloparsec. However,
interactions between jets and the interstellar medium involve processes
occurring on less than kiloparsec scales. In order to further the
understanding of processes occurring on such scales, we present a suite
of simulations of relativistic jets interacting with a fractal two-phase
interstellar medium with a resolution of two parsecs and a largest scale
of one kiloparsec. The transfer of energy and momentum to the
interstellar medium is considerable, and we find that jets with powers
in the range of 10$^{43}$-10$^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ can
inhibit star formation through the dispersal of dense gas in the galaxy
core. We determine the effectiveness of this process as a function of
the ratio of the jet power to the Eddington luminosity of the black
hole, the pressure of the interstellar medium, and the porosity of the
dense gas.

 abstract = "{We present a time-dependent cosmic-ray (CR) modified shock model for
which the calculated H{$\alpha$} emissivity profile agrees well with the
H{$\alpha$} flux increase ahead of the Balmer-dominated shock at knot g in
Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR), observed by Lee et al. The backreaction
of the CR component on the thermal component is treated in the two-fluid
approximation, and we include thermal particle injection and energy
transfer due to the acoustic instability in the precursor. The transient
state of our model that describes the current state of the shock at knot
g occurs during the evolution from a thermal gas dominated shock to a
smooth CR-dominated shock. Assuming a distance of 2.3 kpc to Tycho's
remnant, we obtain values for the CR diffusion coefficient, {$\kappa$}, the
injection parameter, epsilon, and the timescale for the energy transfer,
{$\tau$}, of {$\kappa$} = 2 {\times} 10$^{24}$ cm$^{2}$
s$^{-1}$, epsilon = 4.2 {\times} 10$^{-3}$, and {$\tau$} = 426
yr, respectively. We have also studied the parameter space for fast (300
km s$^{-1}$ lsim v$_{s}$ lsim 3000 km s$^{-1}$),
time-asymptotically steady shocks and have identified a branch of
solutions, for which the temperature in the CR precursor typically
reaches 2 {\times} 10$^{4}$ to 6 {\times} 10$^{4}$ K and the
bulk acceleration of the flow through the precursor is less than 10 km
s$^{-1}$. These solutions fall into the low CR acceleration
efficiency regime and are relatively insensitive to shock parameters.
This low CR acceleration efficiency branch of solutions may provide a
natural explanation for the line broadening of the H{$\alpha$} narrow
component observed in nonradiative shocks in many SNRs.

dominated shocks. The post-shock temperature and overall compression
increase as the source term in the thermal fluid's energy equation
increases. For sufficiently strong coupling, the solutions are thermally

oscillations of the shock front are damped and a smooth cosmic ray
modified shock develops and propagates away from the cold dense layer. A
large increase in cosmic ray pressure occurs for lower Mach numbers in
radiative cosmic ray modified shocks than in adiabatic cosmic ray
modified shocks. The compression ratio is limited to 7 and steady
solutions do not exhibit a cold dense layer like those in radiative
shocks that are not modified by cosmic rays. If the diffusion length is
much larger than the cooling length, the shock is nearly isothermal. The
structure of such shocks obtained with the two-fluid code agree well
with analytically derived solutions for strictly isothermal flow
containing cosmic rays.<BR />

The inclusion of cosmic rays does not alter the criterion for the
thermal stability of a medium subjected to isobaric perturbations. It
does alter the criteria for the stability of a medium perturbed by small
amplitude sound waves. In the limit of a high background cosmic ray
pressure to thermal pressure ratio, the instability in response to high
