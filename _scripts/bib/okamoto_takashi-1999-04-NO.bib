 abstract = "{We have performed a large cosmological hydrodynamics simulation tailored
to the deep survey with the Hubble Space Telescope made in 2012, the
so-called UDF12 campaign. After making a light-cone output, we have
applied the same colour-selection criteria as the UDF12 campaign to
select galaxies from our simulation, and then, have examined the
physical properties of them as a proxy of the real observed UDF12
galaxies at z {\gt} 7. As a result, we find that the halo mass is almost
linearly proportional to the observed ultraviolet (UV) luminosity (4
{\times} 10$^{11}$M$_{⊙}$ at M$_{UV}$ = -21). The
dust attenuation and UV slope {$\beta$} well correlates with the observed
UV luminosity, which is consistent with observations quantitatively. The
star formation rate (SFR) is also linearly proportional to the stellar
mass and the specific SFR shows only a weak dependence on the mass. We
also find an increasing star formation history with a time-scale of
{\tilde}100 Myr in the high-z galaxies. An average metallicity weighted
by the Lyman continuum luminosity reaches up to {\gt}0.1 Solar even at z
{\tilde} 10, suggesting a rapid metal enrichment. We also expect {\ge}0.1
mJy at 350 GHz of the dust thermal emission from the galaxies with
H$_{160}$ {\le} 27, which can be detectable with the Atacama Large
Millimetre-sub-millimetre Array. The galaxies selected by the UDF12
survey contribute to only 52-12 per cent of the cosmic SFR density from
z {\tilde} 7 to z {\tilde} 10, respectively. The James Webb Space
Telescope will push the detection fraction up to 77-72 per cent.

simulations named ''Phantom-GRAPE'' which highly accelerates force
calculations among particles by use of a new SIMD instruction set
extension to the x86 architecture, Advanced Vector eXtensions (AVX), an
enhanced version of the Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE). In our library,
not only the Newton's forces, but also central forces with an arbitrary
shape f(r), which has a finite cutoff radius r$_{cut}$ (i.e.
f(r)=0 at r{\gt}r$_{cut}$), can be quickly computed. In computing
such central forces with an arbitrary force shape f(r), we refer to a
pre-calculated look-up table. We also present a new scheme to create the
look-up table whose binning is optimal to keep good accuracy in
computing forces and whose size is small enough to avoid cache misses.
Using an Intel Core i7-2600 processor, we measure the performance of our
library for both of the Newton's forces and the arbitrarily shaped
central forces. In the case of Newton's forces, we achieve
2{\times}10$^{9}$ interactions per second with one processor core
(or 75 GFLOPS if we count 38 operations per interaction), which is 20
times higher than the performance of an implementation without any
explicit use of SIMD instructions, and 2 times than that with the SSE
instructions. With four processor cores, we obtain the performance of
8{\times}10$^{9}$ interactions per second (or 300 GFLOPS). In the
case of the arbitrarily shaped central forces, we can calculate
1{\times}10$^{9}$ and 4{\times}10$^{9}$ interactions per
second with one and four processor cores, respectively. The performance
with one processor core is 6 times and 2 times higher than those of the
implementations without any use of SIMD instructions and with the SSE
instructions. These performances depend only weakly on the number of
particles, irrespective of the force shape. It is good contrast with the
fact that the performance of force calculations accelerated by graphics
processing units (GPUs) depends strongly on the number of particles.
Substantially weak dependence of the performance on the number of
particles is suitable to collisionless N-body simulations, since these
simulations are usually performed with sophisticated N-body solvers such
as Tree- and TreePM-methods combined with an individual timestep scheme.
We conclude that collisionless N-body simulations accelerated with our
library have significant advantage over those accelerated by GPUs,
especially on massively parallel environments.

Pseudo-bulges are presumed to develop over time as a result of the

formation, in which two disc galaxies with discy pseudo-bulges have
formed. Based on the profile decomposition, the bulge-to-total mass
ratio of the simulated galaxies is 0.6 for one galaxy and 0.3 for the
other. We find that the main formation mechanism of the pseudo-bulges in
our simulations is not the secular evolution of discs but high-redshift
starbursts. The progenitors of the pseudo-bulges form as high-redshift
discs with small scalelengths by the rapid supply of low angular
momentum gas. By redshift 2, before the main disc formation,
pseudo-bulge formation has largely completed in terms of mass. The
secular evolution, such as bar instability, accounts for about 30 per
cent of the bulge mass for one galaxy and only {\tilde}13 per cent for
the other. However, it does affect the final shape and kinematic
properties of the pseudo-bulges.

radiation sources are grouped as a bright extended source when the
group's angular size, {\thetas}$_{s}$, is smaller than a critical
value, {\thetas}$_{crit}$, and radiative transfer is solved on
supermeshes whose angular size is similar to that of the group of
sources. The supermesh structure is constructed by coarse-graining the
mesh structure. With this method, the computational time scales with
N$_{m}$log (N$_{m}$)log (N$_{s}$), where N$_{m}$
and N$_{s}$ are the number of meshes and that of radiation
sources, respectively. While this method is very efficient, it
inevitably overestimates the optical depth when a group of sources acts
as an extended powerful radiation source and affects distant meshes. In
the other prescription, a distant group of sources is treated as a
bright point source ignoring the spatial extent of the group, and the
radiative transfer is solved on the meshes rather than the supermeshes.
This prescription is simply a grid-based version of START by Hasegawa
{\amp} Umemura and yields better results in general with slightly more
computational cost [?] than the supermesh prescription. Our methods can
easily be implemented to any grid-based hydrodynamic codes and are well
suited to adaptive mesh refinement methods.

distribution. A simple model that takes only dust absorption into
account fails in reproducing LAEs that are also bright in UV, suggesting
that the kind of effect we consider is needed. Our model predicts a
bimodal age distribution for LAEs. Most of the galaxies with large Lyman

the nature of feedback processes that regulate galaxy formation. In our

models in which the wind speed, v$_{w}$, is proportional to the

mass-loading, ), make star formation in satellites sporadic, reproduce
the observed satellite luminosity function reasonably well (down to
M$_{v}$=-7) and match the luminosity-metallicity relation observed
in the Local Group satellites. By contrast, models that assume a
constant wind speed overproduce faint satellites and predict an
incorrect luminosity-metallicity relation. Our simulations therefore
suggest that the feedback processes that operate on the scale of
satellite galaxies should generate galactic outflows whose mass-loading
varies inversely with the depth of the potential.

total spanning 5 orders of magnitude in mass. For haloes of a given
mass, the median specific angular momentum increases with radius as
j({\lt}=r) \~{} r. The direction of the vector varies considerably with
radius: the median angle between the inner ({\lt}\~{}0.25R$_{vir}$)

25{\deg}. To investigate how baryons affect halo spin, we use another
high-resolution simulation, which includes gas cooling, star formation
and feedback. This simulation produces a sample of galaxies with a
realistic distribution of disc-to-total ratios, D/T: two-thirds of the
galaxies have D/T {\gt} 0.5 in the B band. The formation of the galaxy
spins up the dark matter within 0.1R$_{vir}$ such that the
specific halo angular momentum increases by \~{}50 per cent in the median.
The dark matter angular momentum becomes better aligned, but there
remains a broad distribution of (mis-)alignments between the halo and
the central galaxy, with a median angle between their angular momenta of

the halo: half of them have their minor axes misaligned by more than

30{\deg} of the plane perpendicular to the major axis of their halo.
Finally, we align a sample of haloes according to the orientation of
their galaxies and stack the projected mass distributions. Although the
individual haloes are significantly aspherical, galaxy-halo
misalignments produce a stacked mass distribution that cannot be
distinguished from circular. If the lack of alignment found in our
simulations is realistic, it will be extremely difficult for weak
lensing studies to measure the ellipticity of cold dark matter haloes

effects of the early re-ionization of gas. These impose a sharp
threshold of \~{}12kms$^{-1}$ on the circular velocity of haloes

typically grown to have circular velocities of {\gt}\~{}20 km

velocities today which were, nevertheless, below threshold at
re-ionization and thus remain dark. Star formation in above-threshold
haloes is truncated when the halo is accreted into the main galaxy

formation of star clusters. This is consistent with observations of
interacting galaxies. The probability distribution function (PDF) of the

The compression of gas at the collision interface between the gas disks
first appears as an excess at n$_{H}$ {\tilde} 10cm$^{-3}$ in
the PDF, and then it moves to higher densities (n$_{H}$ gtrsim 100
cm$^{-3}$) in a few times 10$^{7}$years, where starburst
takes place. After the starburst, the PDF goes back to a quasi-steady
state. These results give a simple picture of starburst phenomena in

assumptions for the baryonic physics, one of the simulations produced a
bulge-dominated galaxy and the other one a disc-dominated galaxy. The
main difference is the treatment of star formation and feedback, both of
which were designed to be more efficient in the disc-dominated object.
We find that the specific angular momentum of the disc-dominated galaxy
tracks the evolution of the angular momentum of the dark matter halo
very closely: the angular momentum grows as predicted by linear theory
until the epoch of maximum expansion and remains constant thereafter. By
contrast, the evolution of the angular momentum of the bulge-dominated
galaxy resembles that of the central, most bound halo material: it also
grows at first according to linear theory, but 90 per cent of it is
rapidly lost as pre-galactic fragments, into which gas had cooled
efficiently, merge, transferring their orbital angular momentum to the
outer halo by tidal effects. The disc-dominated galaxy avoids this fate
because the strong feedback reheats the gas, which accumulates in an
extended hot reservoir and only begins to cool once the merging activity
has subsided. Our analysis lends strong support to the classical theory
of disc formation whereby tidally torqued gas is accreted into the
centre of the halo conserving its angular momentum.

galactic nuclei (AGN) in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation.
We assume that a fraction of jet energy, which is generated by an AGN,
is transferred to the surrounding gas as thermal energy. Combining a
theoretical model of mass accretion on to black holes with a multiphase
description of star-forming gas, we self-consistently follow evolution
of both galaxies and their central black holes. The novelty in our model
is that we consider two distinct accretion modes: standard radiatively
efficient thin accretion discs and radiatively inefficient accretion
flows which we will generically refer to as RIAFs; motivated by
theoretical models for jet production in accretion discs, we assume that
only the RIAF is responsible for the AGN feedback. The focus of this
paper is to investigate the interplay between galaxies and their central
black holes during the formation of a disc galaxy. We find that, after
an initial episode of bursting star formation, the accretion rate on to
the central black hole drops so that the accretion disc switches to a
RIAF structure. At this point, the feedback from the AGN becomes
efficient and slightly suppresses star formation in the galactic disc
and almost completely halts star formation in the bulge. This
suppression of the star formation regulates mass accretion on to the
black hole and associated AGN feedback. As a result, the nucleus becomes
a stochastically fuelled low-luminosity AGN (Seyfert galaxy) with
recurrent short-lived episodes of activity after the star bursts. During
the `on' events, the AGN produces reasonably powerful jets (radio-loud
state) and is less luminous than the host galaxy, while in the `off'
phase, the nucleus is inactive and `radio quiet'. Our model predicts
several properties of the low-luminosity AGN including the bolometric
luminosity, jet powers, the effect on kpc scale of the radio jet and the
AGN lifetime, which are in broad agreement with observations of Seyfert
galaxies and their radio activity. We also find that the ratios between
the central black hole mass and the mass of the host spheroid at z = 0
are \~{}10$^{-3}$ regardless of the strength of either supernova
feedback or AGN feedback because the radiation drag model directly
relates the star formation activity in the Galactic Centre and the mass
accretion rate on to the central black hole.

massive stars and thermal conduction. Feedback in the ambient phase
cycles gas into a hot galactic fountain or wind. We model the ambient

cannot resolve the Jeans mass in the cold and dense molecular gas and,
therefore, represent the cloud phase with ballistic particles that
coagulate when colliding. We show that this naturally produces a
multiphase medium with cold clouds, a warm disc, hot supernova bubbles
and a hot, tenuous halo. Our implementation of this model is based on
the GADGET N-body code. We illustrate the model by evolving an isolated
Milky Way-like galaxy and study the properties of a disc formed in a
rotating spherical collapse. Many observed properties of disc galaxies
are reproduced well, including the molecular cloud mass spectrum, the
molecular fraction as a function of radius, the Schmidt law, the stellar

two out of three systems with sufficiently large satellite populations,
the satellite system is nearly perpendicular to the plane of the
galactic disc, a configuration analogous to that observed in the Milk
Way. The discs themselves are perpendicular to the minor axis of their
host haloes in the inner parts, and the correlation between the

discuss how physical processes affect the metal abundance ratio by

Our analysis on the formation and evolution of the galaxy and its
substructures continues until z=2.0. In such a high-redshift universe,
the Einstein-de Sitter universe is still a good approximation for the
recently favored {$\Lambda$}-dominated universe, and thus our results do
not depend on the choice of cosmology. In order to resolve small
gravitationally bound clumps around galaxies and consider radiative
cooling below T=10$^{4}$ K, we adopt a fine mass resolution
(m$_{SPH}$=1.12{\times}10$^{3}$ M$_{solar}$). Because
of the cooling, each clump immediately forms a ``core-halo'' structure
that consists of a baryonic core and a dark matter halo. The tidal force
from the host galaxy mainly strips the dark matter halo from clumps, and
as a result, these clumps get dominated by baryons. Once a clump is
captured by the host halo, its mass drastically decreases with each
pericenter passage. At z=2, more than half of the clumps become
baryon-dominated systems (baryon mass/total mass{\gt}0.5). Our results
support the tidal evolution scenario of the formation of globular

in galaxies with an early-type morphology. Models in which the
starbursts are induced by strong shocks lead to extended discs. In this
case, the feedback associated with the bursts suppresses the collapse of

from the cores, as well as complex inner structures. The galaxy
distributions in the inner regions of the clusters look similar to the
X-ray intensity maps, suggesting that most of the optical structures
trace physically bound systems. We also compared the structures of the
three clusters with those of model clusters in a numerical simulation
(N-body + semi-analytic model) by parameterising the shapes of the
iso-density contours of galaxies, and found a broad agreement. Our
results that cluster-scale assembly takes place along filaments during
hierarchical clustering need to be confirmed spectroscopically in the
near future.

 abstract = "{We investigate the evolution of angular momentum in smoothed particle
hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations of galaxy formation, paying particular
attention to artificial numerical effects. We find that a cold gas disc
forming in an ambient hot gas halo receives a strong hydrodynamic torque
from the hot gas. By splitting the hydrodynamic force into artificial
viscosity and pressure gradients, we find that the angular momentum
transport is caused not by the artificial viscosity but by the pressure
gradients. Using simple test simulations of shear flows, we conclude
that the pressure gradient-based viscosity can be divided into two
components: one due to the noisiness of SPH and the other due to ram
pressure. The former is problematic even with very high resolution,
because increasing the resolution does not reduce the noisiness. On the
other hand, the ram pressure effect appears only when a cold gas disc or
sheet does not contain enough particles. In such a case, holes form in
the disc or sheet, and then ram pressure from intra-hole hot gas causes
significant deceleration. In simulations of galactic disc formation,
star formation usually decreases the number of cold gas particles, and
hole formation leads to the fragmentation of the disc. This
fragmentation not only induces further angular momentum transport, but
also affects star formation in the disc. To circumvent these problems,
we modify the SPH algorithm, decoupling the cold gas phases from the hot
ones, i.e. inhibiting the hydrodynamic interaction between cold and hot
particles. This, a crude modelling of a multiphase fluid in SPH
cosmological simulations, leads to the formation of smooth extended cold
gas discs and to better numerical convergence. The decoupling is
applicable in so far as the self-gravitating gas disc with negligible
external pressure is a good approximation for a cold gas disc.

clusters at z=0 and 0.5. Some of these indicators are calculated for
both the X-ray surface brightness and projected mass distributions. In
{$\Lambda$}CDM all these indicators tend to be larger than those in OCDM at
z=0. This result is consistent with the analytical prediction of
Richstone, Loeb, {\amp} Turner, that is, clusters in {$\Lambda$}CDM are
formed later than in OCDM and have more substructure at z=0. We perform
a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on each indicator for these two models. We
then find that the results for the multipole-moment power ratios and the
center shifts for the X-ray surface brightness are under the
significance level (5\%). Our results also show that these two
cosmological models can be distinguished more clearly at z=0 than at
z=0.5 by these indicators.

galaxies (L{\gt}L$_{*}$) in a {$\Lambda$}-dominated cold dark matter
universe using a combination of dissipationless N-body simulations and a
semianalytic galaxy formation model. The N-body simulations enable us to
calculate orbits of galaxies in simulated clusters. Therefore, we can
incorporate stripping of cold gas from galactic disks by ram pressure
(RP) from the intracluster medium into our model. In this paper we study
how ram pressure stripping (RPS) and small starburst induced by a minor
merger affect colors, star formation rates (SFRs), and morphologies of
cluster galaxies. These processes are new ingredients in our model and
have not been studied sufficiently. We find that the RPS is not
important for colors and SFRs of galaxies in the cluster core if the
star formation timescale is properly chosen, because the star formation
is sufficiently suppressed by consumption of the cold gas in the disks.
Then observed color and SFR gradients can be reproduced without the RPS.
The small starburst triggered by a minor merger hardly affects the SFRs
and colors of the galaxies as well. We also examine whether these two
processes can resolve the known problem that the hierarchical clustering
models based on the major merger-driven bulge formation scenario predict
too few galaxies of intermediate bulge-to-total luminosity ratio (B/T)
in clusters. When the minor burst is taken into account, the
intermediate B/T population is increased, and the observed morphology
gradients in clusters are successfully reproduced. Without the minor
burst, the RPS cannot increase the intermediate B/T population. On the
other hand, when the minor burst is considered, the RPS also plays an
important role in formation of the intermediate B/T galaxies. We present
redshift evolution of morphological fractions predicted by our models.
The predicted number ratios of the intermediate B/T galaxies to the
bulge-dominated galaxies show nearly flat or slightly increasing trends
with increasing redshift. We conclude that these trends are inevitable
when bulges are formed through mergers. We discuss whether our results
conflict with observationally suggested N$_{S0}$/N$_{E}$
evolution in clusters, which is a decreasing function of redshift.

disrupted at z=0. Therefore we improve a method of deriving merging

The main results are as follows: (1) At high redshift (z\~{}=2), the mass
function of the galactic halos that are in the cluster at z=0 is very
similar to that obtained in the field region and agrees well with the
Press-Schechter mass function. (2) The mass function of cluster galaxies
that consist of both galactic halos and tidally stripped galaxies has
hardly evolved since z\~{}=2. This mass function at z=0 is well represented
by the Press-Schechter mass function at z=2. (3) At high redshift
(z{\gt}3), in the region that becomes the cluster, the fraction of
galaxies that have undergone recent merger is larger than that in the
field. After z\~{}3, however, it rapidly decreases and becomes smaller than
that in the field. (4) The fraction of strongly stripped galaxies among
the cluster galaxies begins to increase from z\~{}=0.5. At z=0, a clear
correlation appears between this fraction and the distance from the
center of the cluster. (5) Tidally truncated halos have steeper outer
