 abstract = "{Galaxies and massive black holes (BHs) presumably grow via galactic
merging events and subsequent BH coalescence. As a case study, we
investigate the merging event between the Andromeda galaxy (M31) and a
satellite galaxy. We compute the expected observational appearance of
the massive BH that was at the center of the satellite galaxy prior to
the merger and is currently wandering in the M31 halo. We demonstrate
that a radiatively inefficient accretion flow with a bolometric
luminosity of a few tens of solar luminosities develops when
Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion onto the BH is assumed. We compute the
associated broadband spectrum and show that the radio band (observable
with EVLA, ALMA, and the Square Kilometre Array) is the best frequency
range in which to detect the emission. We also evaluate the mass and the
luminosity of the stars bound by the wandering BH and find that such a
star cluster is sufficiently luminous that it could correspond to one of
the star clusters found by the PAndAS survey. The discovery of a relic
massive BH wandering in a galactic halo will provide a direct means of
investigating in detail the coevolution of galaxies and BHs. It also
means a new population of BHs (off-center massive BHs) and offers
targets for clean BH imaging that avoid strong interstellar scattering
in the centers of galaxies.

 abstract = "{In the hierarchical structure formation scenario, galaxies enlarge
through multiple merging events with less massive galaxies. In addition,
the Magorrian relation indicates that almost all galaxies are occupied
by a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) of mass
10$^{-3}$ times the mass of its spheroidal component.
Consequently, SMBHs are expected to wander in the halos of their host
galaxies following a galaxy collision, although evidence of this
activity is currently lacking. We investigate a current plausible
location of an SMBH wandering in the halo of the Andromeda galaxy (M31).
According to theoretical studies of N-body simulations, some of the many
substructures in the M31 halo are remnants of a minor merger occurring
about 1 Gyr ago. First, to evaluate the possible parameter space of the
infalling orbit of the progenitor, we perform numerous parameter studies
using a graphics processing unit cluster. To reduce uncertainties in the
predicted position of the expected SMBH, we then calculate the time
evolution of the SMBH in the progenitor dwarf galaxy from N-body
simulations using the plausible parameter sets. Our results show that
the SMBH lies within the halo (\~{}20-50 kpc from the M31 center), closer
to the Milky Way than the M31 disk. Furthermore, the predicted current
positions of the SMBH were restricted to an observational field of
0.{\deg}6 {\times} 0.{\deg}7 in the northeast region of the M31 halo. We
also discuss the origin of the infalling orbit of the satellite galaxy
and its relationships with the recently discovered vast thin disk plane
of satellite galaxies around M31.

spectral variability of nearly 9000 quasars (0 {\lt} z {\lt} 4) using

regression slope in the flux-flux space of a quasar light curve directly
measures the color of the flux difference spectrum, then the spectral
shape of the flux difference spectra can be derived by taking a careful
look at the redshift dependence of the regression slopes. First, we
confirm that the observed quasar spectrum becomes bluer when the quasar
becomes brighter. We infer the spectral index of the composite
difference spectrum as $\backslash$alpha \_$\{$$\backslash$nu $\}$\^{}$\{$dif$\}$$\backslash$sim +1/3 (in the form of
f\_$\{$$\backslash$nu $\}$$\backslash$propto $\backslash$nu \^{}$\{$$\backslash$alpha \_$\{$$\backslash$nu $\}$$\}$), which is significantly bluer
than that of the composite spectrum $\backslash$alpha \_$\{$$\backslash$nu $\}$\^{}$\{$com$\}$$\backslash$sim -0.5. We
also show that the continuum variability cannot be explained by
accretion disk models with varying mass accretion rates. Second, we
examine the effects of broad emission line variability on the
color-redshift space. The variability of the ''Small Blue Bump'' is
extensively discussed. We show that the low-ionization lines of Mg II
and Fe II are less variable compared to Balmer emission lines and
high-ionization lines, and the Balmer continuum is the dominant variable
source around \~{}3000 {\AA}. These results are compared with previous
studies, and the physical mechanisms of the variability of the continuum

 abstract = "{We report on X-ray spectral and timing results of a new black hole
candidate (BHC), MAXI J1659-152, with an orbital period of 2.41 hr
(shortest among BHCs) in a 2010 outburst from 65 Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer (RXTE) observations and 8 simultaneous Swift and RXTE
observations. According to the definitions of the spectral states in
Remillard and McClintock (2006, ARA{\amp}A, 44, 49), most of the
observations have been classified into the intermediate state. All of
the X-ray broadband spectra can be modeled by a multi-color disk plus a
power-law with an exponential cutoff or a multi-color disk plus a
Comptonization component. During the initial phase of the outburst, a
high-energy cutoff was visible at 30-40 keV. The innermost radius of the
disk gradually decreased by a factor of more than 3 from the onset of
the outburst, and reached a constant value of 35d$_{10}$cos
i$^{-1/2}$ km, where d$_{10}$ is the distance in units of 10
kpc and i is the inclination. The type-C quasi-periodic oscillation
(QPO) frequency varied from 1.6 Hz to 7.3 Hz in association with a
change of the innermost radius, while the innermost radius remained
constant during the type-B QPO detections at 1.6-4.1 Hz. Hence, we
suggest that the origin of the type-B QPOs is different from that of
type-C QPOs, the latter of which would originate from the disk
truncation radius. Assuming the constant innermost radius in the latter
phase of the outburst as the innermost stable circular orbit, the black
hole mass in MAXI J1659-152 is estimated to be 3.6-8.0M$_{&sun;}$
for a distance of 5.3-8.6 kpc and an inclination angle of
60{\deg}-75{\deg}.

 abstract = "{According to recent models, the accretion disk and black hole in active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) are surrounded by a clumpy torus. We investigate
the NIR flux variation of the torus in response to a UV flash for
various geometries. Anisotropic illumination by the disk and the torus
self-occultation contrast our study with earlier works. Both the waning
effect of each clump and the torus self-occultation selectively reduce
the emission from the region with a short delay. Therefore, the NIR
delay depends on the viewing angle (where a more inclined angle leads to
a longer delay), and the time response shows an asymmetric profile with
negative skewness, opposing the results for optically thin tori. The
range of the computed delay coincides with the observed one, suggesting
that the viewing angle is primarily responsible for the scatter of the
observed delay. We also propose that the red NIR-to-optical color of
type 1.8/1.9 objects is caused not only by the dust extinction but also
the intrinsically red color. Compared with the modest torus thickness,
both a thick and a thin tori display weaker NIR emission. A selection
bias is thus expected such that NIR-selected AGNs tend to possess
moderately thick tori. A thicker torus shows a narrower and more heavily
skewed time profile, while a thin torus produces a rapid response. A
super-Eddington accretion rate leads to much weaker NIR emission due to
the disk self-occultation and the disk truncation by self-gravity. A
long delay is expected from an optically thin and/or a largely
misaligned torus. Very weak NIR emission, such as in hot-dust-poor
active nuclei, can arise from a geometrically thin torus, a
super-Eddington accretion rate, or a slightly misaligned torus.

active galactic nuclei. However, the observed inner radius of the torus
is systematically smaller than the expected radius by a factor of \~{}1/3.
We show that the anisotropy of the emission from accretion disks
resolves this conflict naturally and quantitatively. An accretion disk
emits lesser radiation in the direction closer to its equatorial plane
(i.e., to the torus). We find that the anisotropy makes the torus inner
region closer to the central black hole and concave. Moreover, the
innermost edge of the torus may connect with the outermost edge of the
disk continuously. Considering the anisotropic emission of each clump in
the torus, we calculate the near-infrared flux variation in response to
a UV flash. For an observer at the polar angle {\thetas}$_{obs}$ =
25{\deg}, the centroid of the time delay is found to be 37\% of the delay
expected in the case of isotropic illumination, which explains the
observed systematic deviation.

black hole binaries (BHBs), are known to show state transitions similar
to Galactic BHBs. However, the relation between the ULX states and the
Galactic BHB states is still unclear, primarily due to the less
well-understood behaviors of ULXs in contrast to the Galactic BHBs.
Here, we report a statistical X-ray spectral study of 34 energy spectra
from seven bright ULXs in the interacting galaxy systems M 51 and NGC
4490/85, using archive data from multiple Chandra and XMM-Newton
observations spanning a few years. In order to compare them with
Galactic BHB states, we applied representative spectral models of
BHBs{\mdash}a power-law (PL), a multi-color disk blackbody (MCD), and a
slim-disk model{\mdash}to all the ULX spectra. We found a hint of a
bimodal structure in the luminosity distribution of the samples,
suggesting that ULXs have two states that respectively have typical
luminosities of (3-6){\times} 10$^{39}$ and (1.5-3){\times}
10$^{39}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. Most spectra in the brighter state
are explained by the MCD or the slim-disk model, whereas those in the
fainter state are explained by the PL model. In particular, the
slim-disk model successfully explains the observed spectral variations
of NGC 4490/85 ULX-6 and ULX-8 by changes of the mass accretion rate to
a black hole of an estimated mass of {\lt}40 M $_{sun}$. From the
best-fit model parameters of each state, we speculate that the brighter
state in these two ULXs corresponds to the brightest state of Galactic
BHBs, which is often called the ''apparently standard state.'' The fainter
state of the ULXs has a PL-shaped spectrum, but the photon index range
is much wider than that seen in any single state of Galactic BHBs. We
thus speculate that it is a state unique to ULXs. Some sources show much
fainter and steeper spectra than the faint state, which we identified as
yet another state.

appropriate values of the model parameters in their natural ranges. Our
scenario can be observationally tested in near future because the mass
of PBHs is uniquely determined once we specify the values of the
amplitude of the curvature perturbation, spectral index and its running
on large scales.

estimating dynamical masses and bulge masses M$_{bulge}$ for these

M$_{bulge}$ in those NLS1s in the near future

of the preexisting stars). Bulge growth may have finished before BH
growth, or bulge-BH coevolution may proceed with many occasionally
discrete events, where one coevolution event produces only a small
amount of mass growth of BHs and bulges. We also discuss the ratios of
star formation rate to gas accretion rate onto BHs, finding that two
NLS1s have very small ratios (\~{}1) compared with the
M$_{bulge}$/M$_{BH}$ ratios found in active and inactive
galaxies (\~{}700). This huge difference suggests either nonoverlapped
coevolution, a long star formation duration, or a temporarily high

discriminate different X-ray continuum spectral models. Neither the
standard accretion disk model [where the radial dependency of the disk
effective temperature is T(r)\~{}r$^{-3/4}$] nor a power-law model
gives a satisfactory fit. In fact, observed curvature of the M82 X-1
spectrum was just between those of the two models. When the exponent of
the radial dependence [p in T(r)\~{}r$^{-p}$] of the disk temperature
is allowed to be free, we obtained
p=0.61$^{+0.03}$$_{-0.02}$. Such a reduction of p from the
standard value 3/4 under extremely high mass accretion rates is
predicted from the accretion disk theory as a consequence of the radial
energy advection. Thus, the accretion disk in M82 X-1 is considered to
be in the slim-disk state, where an optically thick advection-dominated
accretion flow is taking place. We have applied a theoretical slim-disk

stellar black hole that has been produced through evolution of an
extremely massive star, shining at a super-Eddington luminosity by
several times the Eddington limit.

to be strong candidates of IMBHs by several authors. We first tried
fitting by the standard spectral model of disk blackbody (DBB) +
power-law (PL), finding good fits to all of the data, in agreement with
others. We, however, found that the PL component dominates the DBB
component at {\tilde}0.3 to 10keV. Thus, the black hole parameters
derived solely from the minor DBB component are questionable. Next, we
tried to fit the same data by the ``p-free disk model'' without the PL
component, assuming an effective temperature profile of T$_{eff}$
{\prop} r$^{-p}$, where r is the disk radius. Interestingly, in
spite of one less free-model parameter, we obtained similarly good fits
with much higher innermost disk temperatures, 1.8 {\lt} kT$_{in}$
{\lt} 3.2keV. More importantly, we obtained p {\tilde} 0.5, just the value
predicted by the slim (super-critical) disk theory, rather than p = 0.75
that is expected from the standard disk model. The estimated black hole
masses from the p-free disk model are much smaller; M lesssim
40M$_{odot}$. Furthermore, we applied a more sophisticated
slim-disk model by Kawaguchi (2003, ApJ, 593, 69), and obtained good
fits with roughly consistent black hole masses. We thus conclude that
the central engines of these ULXs are super-critical accretion flows to
stellar-mass black holes.

 abstract = "{Our current theoretical and observational understandings of the
accretion disks around Galactic black-holes are reviewed. Historically,
a simple phenomenological accretion disk model has been used to
interpret X-ray observations. Although such a phenomenological
interpretation is still useful, high quality X-ray data from
contemporary instruments allow us to test more realistic accretion disk
models. In a simple and ideal case, the standard optically thick
accretion disk model is successful to explain observations, such that
the inner disk radius is constant at three times the Schwarzschild
radius over large luminosity variations. However, when disk luminosity
is close to or exceeds the Eddington luminosity, the standard disk model
breaks, and we have to consider the ''slim disk'' solution in which radial
energy advection is dominant. Recent observations of Ultra-luminous
X-ray sources (ULXs), which may not be explained by the standard disk
model, strongly suggest the slim disk solution. We compare theoretical
X-ray spectra from the slim disk with observed X-ray spectra of ULXs. We
have found that the slim disk model is successful to explain ULX
spectra, in terms of the massive stellar black-holes with several tens
of solar mass and the super-Eddington mass accretion rates. In order to
explain the large luminosities ({\gt}10 $^{40}$ ergs s
$^{-1}$) of ULXs, ''intermediate black-holes'' ({\gt}100
M$_{&sun;}$) are not required. Slim disks around massive stellar
black-holes of up to several tens of solar mass would naturally explain
the observed properties of ULXs.

in both objects are broad (1000-2000 km s$^{-1}$), and those in

blueshift and the profile of the [O III] lines as the result of an
outflow interacting with circumnuclear gas. Among type 1 AGNs with large
blueshifted [O III], there is no correlation between the Eddington
ratios and the amount of [O III] blueshift. Combining our new data with
published results, we confirm that the Eddington ratios of such AGNs are
the highest among AGNs with the same black hole mass. These facts
suggest that the Eddington ratio is a necessary condition for [O III]
blueshifts or that the [O III] blueshifts weakly depend on the Eddington
ratio. Our new sample suggests that there are possibly other necessary
conditions to produce an outflow than a high Eddington ratio: a large

systems, is really young: the inferred age, M$_{BH}$/M, is about
10$^{6}$ yr. We also briefly discuss the distribution of m for
transient and highly variable NLS1s, finding that those are located at

LFs at the NIR bands are; about a one order of magnitude difference is

the disk becomes a slim disk and exhibits the following distinctive
signatures: (1) The disk luminosity (particularly of X-rays) is
insensitive to the mass-flow rates, dot M, since the generated energy is
partly carried away to the black hole by trapped photons in accretion
flow. (2) The spectra are multi-color blackbody. The maximum blackbody

the size of the blackbody emitting region is small, r\_bb {\lt}\~{} 3 r\_S
