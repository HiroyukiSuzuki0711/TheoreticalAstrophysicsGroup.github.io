 abstract = "{We have developed a numerical software library for collisionless N-body
simulations named ''Phantom-GRAPE'' which highly accelerates force
calculations among particles by use of a new SIMD instruction set
extension to the x86 architecture, Advanced Vector eXtensions (AVX), an
enhanced version of the Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE). In our library,
not only the Newton's forces, but also central forces with an arbitrary
shape f(r), which has a finite cutoff radius r$_{cut}$ (i.e.
f(r)=0 at r{\gt}r$_{cut}$), can be quickly computed. In computing
such central forces with an arbitrary force shape f(r), we refer to a
pre-calculated look-up table. We also present a new scheme to create the
look-up table whose binning is optimal to keep good accuracy in
computing forces and whose size is small enough to avoid cache misses.
Using an Intel Core i7-2600 processor, we measure the performance of our
library for both of the Newton's forces and the arbitrarily shaped
central forces. In the case of Newton's forces, we achieve
2{\times}10$^{9}$ interactions per second with one processor core
(or 75 GFLOPS if we count 38 operations per interaction), which is 20
times higher than the performance of an implementation without any
explicit use of SIMD instructions, and 2 times than that with the SSE
instructions. With four processor cores, we obtain the performance of
8{\times}10$^{9}$ interactions per second (or 300 GFLOPS). In the
case of the arbitrarily shaped central forces, we can calculate
1{\times}10$^{9}$ and 4{\times}10$^{9}$ interactions per
second with one and four processor cores, respectively. The performance
with one processor core is 6 times and 2 times higher than those of the
implementations without any use of SIMD instructions and with the SSE
instructions. These performances depend only weakly on the number of
particles, irrespective of the force shape. It is good contrast with the
fact that the performance of force calculations accelerated by graphics
processing units (GPUs) depends strongly on the number of particles.
Substantially weak dependence of the performance on the number of
particles is suitable to collisionless N-body simulations, since these
simulations are usually performed with sophisticated N-body solvers such
as Tree- and TreePM-methods combined with an individual timestep scheme.
We conclude that collisionless N-body simulations accelerated with our
library have significant advantage over those accelerated by GPUs,
especially on massively parallel environments.

 abstract = "{We present a scheme for numerical simulations of collisionless
self-gravitating systems which directly integrates the Vlasov-Poisson
equations in six-dimensional phase space. Using the results from a suite
of large-scale numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the present
scheme can simulate collisionless self-gravitating systems properly. The
integration scheme is based on the positive flux conservation method
recently developed in plasma physics. We test the accuracy of our code
by performing several test calculations, including the stability of King
spheres, the gravitational instability, and the Landau damping. We show
that the mass and the energy are accurately conserved for all the test
cases we study. The results are in good agreement with linear theory
predictions and/or analytic solutions. The distribution function keeps
the property of positivity and remains non-oscillatory. The largest
simulations are run on 64$^{6}$ grids. The computation speed
scales well with the number of processors, and thus our code performs
efficiently on massively parallel supercomputers.

near-future X-ray detectors. The quality of image reconstruction is poor
with the 12 m array alone, but improved significantly by adding ACA; the
expected sensitivity of the 12 m array based on the thermal noise is not
valid for the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect mapping unless accompanied by an
ACA observation of at least equal duration. The observations above 100
GHz will become excessively time-consuming owing to the narrower beam
size and the higher system temperature. On the other hand, significant
improvement of the observing efficiency is expected once Band 1 is

parallelized the code by using so-called NINJA scheme ( Nitadori et al.,

 abstract = "{We present two types of numerical prescriptions that accelerate the
radiative transfer calculation around point sources within a
three-dimensional Cartesian grid by using the oct-tree structure for the
distribution of radiation sources. In one prescription, distant
radiation sources are grouped as a bright extended source when the
group's angular size, {\thetas}$_{s}$, is smaller than a critical
value, {\thetas}$_{crit}$, and radiative transfer is solved on
supermeshes whose angular size is similar to that of the group of
sources. The supermesh structure is constructed by coarse-graining the
mesh structure. With this method, the computational time scales with
N$_{m}$log (N$_{m}$)log (N$_{s}$), where N$_{m}$
and N$_{s}$ are the number of meshes and that of radiation
sources, respectively. While this method is very efficient, it
inevitably overestimates the optical depth when a group of sources acts
as an extended powerful radiation source and affects distant meshes. In
the other prescription, a distant group of sources is treated as a
bright point source ignoring the spatial extent of the group, and the
radiative transfer is solved on the meshes rather than the supermeshes.
This prescription is simply a grid-based version of START by Hasegawa
{\amp} Umemura and yields better results in general with slightly more
computational cost [?] than the supermesh prescription. Our methods can
easily be implemented to any grid-based hydrodynamic codes and are well
suited to adaptive mesh refinement methods.

FeXXVI K{$\alpha$} line emissions is significantly altered from that in the
ionization equilibrium state. If the effect of the two-temperature
structure of ICM is incorporated, the electron temperature is
{\tilde}10\%-20\% and {\tilde}30\%-50\% lower than the mean temperature of ICM
at the shock layers in the outskirts and in front of the ICM cores,
respectively, and the deviation from the ionization equilibrium state

identified as clumps of cold and dense gas particles and classified as
young and old galaxies according to their formation epochs. We find that
the pairwise velocity dispersion (PVD) of all galaxies is significantly
lower than that of the dark matter particles and that the PVD of the
young galaxies is lower than that of the old types, and even of all
galaxies together, especially at small separations. These results are in
reasonable agreement with the recent measurements of PVDs in the Las
Campanas redshift survey, the IRAS Point Source Catalogue Redshift
Survey, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. We also find that the low
PVD of young galaxies is due to the effects of dynamical friction as
well as the different spatial distribution, while the difference in the
PVD between all galaxies and dark matter can be mostly ascribed to their
different spatial distributions. We also consider the mean infall
velocity and the POTENT density reconstruction that are often used to
measure the cosmological parameters, and investigate the effects of
spatial bias and dynamical friction. In our simulation, the mean infall
velocity of young galaxies is significantly lower than that of all the
galaxies or of the old galaxies, and the dynamical bias becomes
important on scales less than 3h$^{-1}$Mpc. The mass density field
reconstructed from the velocity field of young galaxies using the
POTENT-style method suffers in accuracy from both the spatial bias and
the dynamical friction on the smoothing scale of
R$_{s}$=8h$^{-1}$Mpc. On the other hand, in the case of
R$_{s}$=12h$^{-1}$Mpc, which is typically adopted in the
actual POTENT analysis, the density reconstruction based on various
tracers of galaxies is reasonably accurate. We also analyze the motions
of central galaxies and the velocity dispersion of galaxies within halos

Richstone, Loeb, {\amp} Turner, that is, clusters in {$\Lambda$}CDM are
formed later than in OCDM and have more substructure at z=0. We perform
a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on each indicator for these two models. We
then find that the results for the multipole-moment power ratios and the

LFs at the NIR bands are; about a one order of magnitude difference is

simulations. We identify galaxies by linking cold and dense gas
particles that satisfy the Jeans criterion. We compare their biasing
properties with the predictions of an analytic halo biasing model. Dark
halos in our simulations exhibit reasonable agreement with the
predictions only on scales larger than \~{}10 h$^{-1}$ Mpc; on
smaller scales, the volume exclusion effect of halos due to their finite
size becomes substantial. Interestingly, the biasing properties of
galaxies are better described by extrapolating the halo biasing model
predictions. The clustering amplitudes of galaxies are almost
independent of the redshift between z=0 and 3, as reported in previous
simulations. This in turn leads to a rapidly evolving biasing factor; we
find that b$_{cov}$\~{}=1 at redshift z\~{}=0 and b$_{cov}$\~{}=3-4
at z=3, where b$_{cov}$ is a biasing parameter defined from the
linear regression of galaxy and dark matter density fields. Those values
are consistent with the observed clustering of Lyman break galaxies. We
also find the clear dependence of galaxy biasing on formation epoch; the
distribution of old populations of galaxies tightly correlates with the
underlying mass density field while that of young populations is
slightly more stochastic and antibiased relative to dark matter. The
amplitude of the two-point correlation function of old populations is
about 3 times larger than that of young populations. Furthermore, the
old population of galaxies resides within massive dark halos while the
young galaxies are preferentially formed in smaller dark halos. Assuming
that the observed early- and late-type galaxies correspond to the
simulated old and young populations of galaxies, respectively, all of
these segregations of galaxies are consistent with observational ones
for early- and late-type galaxies such as, e.g., the morphology-density
relation of galaxies.

Millimeter and Submillimeter Array (ALMA/LMSA). We first calculate the
source counts from 350 {$\mu$}m to 3 mm using the empirical infrared galaxy
number count model of Takeuchi et al. Based on the number counts, we
evaluate the source confusion and determine the confusion limit at
various wave bands as a function of the characteristic beam size. At
submillimeter wavelengths, source confusion with the 10-15 m class
facilities becomes severe at the 0.1-1 mJy level, and astrometry and
flux measurements will be difficult. However, we show that a very large
area survey of submillimeter sources brighter than 10-50 mJy can provide
a unique constraint on infrared galaxy evolution at z=1-2, and such a
survey is suitable for the ASTE. In addition, such a survey enables us
to study the clustering properties of submillimeter sources, which are
still highly unknown. We also find that the 5 {$\sigma$} confusion limit of
LMSA is fainter than 1 {$\mu$}Jy, which enables us to study the
contribution of sources at extremely large redshift. When we discuss
such a deep flux limit, the dynamic range of a detector should be taken
into account, since extremely bright sources make it impossible to
detect the faintest sources near the detection limit. We evaluate the
probability that sources that are 10$^{3}$ times brighter than the
5 {$\sigma$} detection limit of LMSA and ALMA exist in the field of view.
We find that the probability is {\lt}\~{}3{\times}10$^{-4}$, and
therefore we do not have to worry about the dynamic range. The source
counts at such faint flux levels give important information about the
epoch of galaxy formation. We then show that multiband photometry from
the infrared (by ASTRO-F) to the millimeter can be used as a redshift
estimator. We examined the performance of this method by Monte Carlo
simulations and found that it works successfully if we have reasonable
measurement accuracy. In addition, we compare the observed 1.4, 5, and 8
GHz source counts with our model counts to examine the contribution of
star-forming galaxies to faint radio galaxies. We find that the faintest
radio number counts (\~{}1 {$\mu$}Jy) are dominated by actively star-forming

order-of-magnitude increase of the far-infrared (FIR) luminosity at
redshift z=0.5-1.0 is necessary to reproduce the very high CIRB
intensity at 140 {$\mu$} m reported by Hauser et al. (1998, AAA
070.161.559) and decreases to, even at most, a factor of 10 toward z--5,
though many variants are allowed within these constraints. This
evolution history also satisfies the constraints from the galaxy number
counts obtained by IRAS, ISO and, roughly, SCUBA. The rapid evolution of
the comoving IR luminosity density required from the CIRB well
reproduces the very steep slope of galaxy number counts obtained by ISO.
We also estimate the cosmic star formation history (SFH) from the
obtained FIR luminosity density, considering the effect of the metal
enrichment in galaxies. The derived SFH increases steeply with redshift
in 0 {\lt} z {\lt} 0.75, and becomes flat or even declines atz {\gt} 0.75 .
This is consistent with the SFH estimated from the reported ultraviolet

derive secure information of galaxy evolution up to z-1 from the survey,

 abstract = "{We study statistical methods for the estimation of the luminosity
function (LF) of galaxies. We focus on four nonparametric estimators:
the 1/V$_{max}$ estimator, the stepwise maximum-likelihood
estimator, Cho{\l}oniewski's estimator, and the improved Lynden-Bell
estimator. The performance of the 1/V$_{max}$ estimator has
recently been questioned, especially for the faint-end estimation of the
LF. We improve these estimators for studies of the distant universe, and
examine their performances for various classes of functional forms by
Monte Carlo simulations. We also apply these estimation methods to the
mock Two-Degree Field (2dF) redshift survey catalog prepared by Cole et
al. We find that the 1/V$_{max}$ estimator yields a completely
unbiased result if there is no inhomogeneity, but is not robust against
clusters or voids. This is consistent with the well-known results, and
we do not confirm the bias trend of 1/V$_{max}$ claimed by Willmer
in the case of a homogeneous sample. We also find that the other three
maximum-likelihood type estimators are quite robust and give consistent
results with each other. In practice, we recommend Cho{\l}oniewski's
estimator for two reasons: (1) it simultaneously provides the shape and
normalization of the LF; and (2) it is the fastest among these four
estimators, because of its algorithmic simplicity. We then analyze the
photometric redshift data of the Hubble Deep Field prepared by
Fern{\'a}ndez-Soto et al. using the above four methods. We also
derive the luminosity density, {$\rho$}$_{L}$, at the B and I bands.
Our B-band estimation is roughly consistent with that of Sawicki, Lin,
{\amp} Yee, but it is a few times lower at 2.0{\lt}z{\lt}3.0. The evolution
of {$\rho$}$_{L}$(I) is found to be less prominent.

 abstract = "{We present results from a series of cosmological smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations coupled with the
particle-particle-particle-mesh solver for the gravitational force. The
simulations are designed to predict the statistical properties of X-ray
clusters of galaxies as well as to study the formation of galaxies. We
have seven simulation runs with different assumptions about the thermal
state of the intracluster gas. Following the recent work by Pearce and
coworkers, we modify our SPH algorithm so as to phenomenologically
incorporate galaxy formation by decoupling the cooled gas particles from
the hot gas particles. All the simulations employ 128$^{3}$
particles both for dark matter and for gas components and thus
constitute the largest systematic catalogs of clusters simulated in the
SPH method performed so far. These enable us to compare the analytical
predictions about statistical properties of X-ray clusters against our
direct simulation results in an unbiased manner. We find that the
luminosities of the simulated clusters are quite sensitive to the
thermal history and also to the numerical resolution of the simulations
and thus are not reliable. On the other hand, the mass-temperature
relation for the simulated clusters is fairly insensitive to the
assumptions of the thermal state of the intracluster gas, is robust
against the numerical resolution, and in fact agrees well with the
analytic prediction. Therefore, prediction of the X-ray temperature
functions of clusters on the basis of the Press-Schechter mass function
and the virial equilibrium is fairly reliable.

the most luminous X-ray cluster RX J1347-1145 at the Nobeyama Radio
Observatory (21 and 43 GHz) and with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope
(350 GHz). In particular, the latter is the first successful detection
of the SZ temperature increment in the submillimeter band that resolved
the profile of a cluster of galaxies. Both the observed spectral
dependence and the radial profile of the SZ signals are fully consistent
with those expected from the X-ray observation of the cluster. The
combined analysis of the 21 and 350 GHz data reproduces the temperature
and core radius of the cluster that are determined with ROSAT and ASCA
when we adopt the slope of the density profile from the X-ray
observations. Therefore, our present data provide the strongest and most
convincing case for the detection of the submillimeter SZ signal from
the cluster as well as in the Rayleigh-Jeans regime. We also discuss
briefly the cosmological implications of the present results.
