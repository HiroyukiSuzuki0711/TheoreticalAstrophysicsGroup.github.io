	Abstract = {{The Double Helix Nebula (DHN), located 100 pc above Sgr A* in the
Galactic center (GC), is a unique structure whose morphology suggests it
is a magnetic feature. Recent molecular observations toward the DHN
revealed two candidate molecular counterparts of the DHN at radial
velocities of {\ndash}35 km s$^{--1}$ and 0 km
s$^{--1}$ and discussed the model in which the DHN has its
origin at the circumnuclear disk in the GC. In this paper, new CO
observations toward the DHN using the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory
and Mopra telescopes are presented. The higher-resolution observations
of \~{}1 pc scale reveal the detailed distributions and kinematics of the
two CO counterparts (the 0 km s$^{--1}$ and {\ndash}35 km
s$^{--1}$ features) and provide new information on their
physical conditions. As a result, we find that the 0 km
s$^{--1}$ feature with a mass of 3.3 {\times} 10$^{4}$ M
$_{&#9737;}$ coincides with the infrared emission of the DHN,
indicating clear association with the DHN. The association of the
{\ndash}35 km s$^{--1}$ feature, with a mass of 0.8 {\times}
10$^{4}$ M $_{&#9737;}$, is less clear compared with the 0
km s$^{--1}$ feature, but the complementary distribution
between the molecular gas and the DHN and velocity variation along the
DHN support its association with the DHN. The two molecular features are
highly excited, as shown by the relatively high CO J = 2-1/J = 1-0
intensity ratios of \~{}1.0, and have kinetic temperatures of \~{}30 K,
consistent with the typical molecular clouds in the GC.

	Abstract = {{We present new large field observations of molecular clouds with NANTEN2
toward the super star cluster NGC 3603 in the transitions
$^{12}$CO(J = 2-1, J = 1-0) and $^{13}$CO(J = 2-1, J = 1-0).
We suggest that two molecular clouds at 13 km s$^{-1}$ and
28 km s$^{-1}$ are associated with NGC 3603 as evidenced by
higher temperatures toward the H II region, as well as morphological
correspondence. The mass of the clouds is too small to gravitationally
bind them, given their relative motion of \~{}20 km s$^{-1}$.
We suggest that the two clouds collided with each other 1 Myr ago to
trigger the formation of the super star cluster. This scenario is able
to explain the origin of the highest mass stellar population in the
cluster, which is as young as 1 Myr and is segregated within the central
sub-pc of the cluster. This is the second super star cluster along with
Westerlund 2 where formation may have been triggered by a cloud-cloud
collision.

	Abstract = {{We present a novel radiation hydrodynamics code, START, which is a
smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme coupled with accelerated
radiative transfer. The basic idea for the acceleration of radiative
transfer is parallel to the tree algorithm that is hitherto used to
speed up the gravitational force calculation in an N-body system. It is
demonstrated that the radiative transfer calculations can be
dramatically accelerated, where the computational time is scaled as
N$_{p}$ logN$_{s}$ for N$_{p}$ SPH particles and
N$_{s}$ radiation sources. Such acceleration allows us to readily
include not only numerous sources but also scattering photons, even if
the total number of radiation sources is comparable to that of SPH
particles. Here, a test simulation is presented for a multiple source
problem, where the results with START are compared to those with a
radiation SPH code without tree-based acceleration. We find that the
results agree well with each other if we set the tolerance parameter as
{\thetas}$_{crit}$ {\lt}= 1.0, and then it demonstrates that START
can solve radiative transfer faster without reducing the accuracy. One
of the important applications with START is to solve the transfer of
diffuse ionizing photons, where each SPH particle is regarded as an
emitter. To illustrate the competence of START, we simulate the
shadowing effect by dense clumps around an ionizing source. As a result,
it is found that the erosion of shadows by diffuse recombination photons
can be solved. Such an effect is of great significance to reveal the
cosmic reionization process.

	Abstract = {{We explore the impact of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from massive
Population III (Pop III) stars of 25, 40, 80 and 120M$_{solar}$ on
the subsequent Pop III star formation. In this paper, particular
attention is paid to the dependence of radiative feedback on the mass of
source Pop III star. UV radiation from the source star can work to
impede the secondary star formation through the photoheating and
photodissociation processes. Recently, Susa and Umemura have shown that
the ionizing radiation alleviates the negative effect by
H$_{2}$-dissociating radiation from 120M$_{solar}$ Pop III
star, since an H$_{2}$ shell formed ahead of an ionizing front can
effectively shield H$_{2}$-dissociating radiation. On the other
hand, it is expected that the negative feedback by
H$_{2}$-dissociating radiation can be predominant if a source star
is less massive, since a ratio of the H$_{2}$-dissociating photon
number to the ionizing photon number becomes higher. In order to
investigate the radiative feedback effects from such less massive stars,
we perform three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations,
incorporating the radiative transfer effect of ionizing and
H$_{2}$-dissociating radiation. As a result, we find that if a
source star is less massive than \~{}25M$_{solar}$, the ionizing
radiation cannot suppress the negative feedback of
H$_{2}$-dissociating radiation. Therefore, the fate of the
neighbouring clouds around such less massive stars is determined solely
by the flux of H$_{2}$-dissociating radiation from source stars.
By making analytic estimates of H$_{2}$ shell formation and its
shielding effect, we derive the criteria for radiation hydrodynamic
feedback depending on the source star mass.

	Abstract = {{We explore the impacts of ultraviolet (UV) radiation feedback on
galaxies during the epoch of reionization by cosmological simulations in
which hydrodynamics and the transfer of the H and He ionizing photons
are consistently coupled. Moreover, we take into account H$_{2}$
non-equilibrium chemistry, including photodissociation. The most
striking feature of the simulations is a high spatial resolution for the
radiative transfer (RT) calculation which enables us to start
considering not only external UV feedback processes but also internal UV
feedback processes in each galaxy. We find that the star formation is
significantly suppressed due to the internal UV and supernova (SN)
feedback. In low-mass galaxies with M {\lt} 10$^{9}$
M$_{&sun;}$, a large amount of gas is evacuated by
photoevaporation as previous studies have shown, which results in the
suppression of star formation. Surprisingly, star formation in massive
haloes is also strongly suppressed despite the fact that these haloes
hardly lose any gas by photoevaporation. The suppression of star
formation in massive haloes is mainly caused by the following two
factors: (i) small-scale clumpy structures in the galaxies are
smoothened by the internal feedback; (ii) although the dense gas in the
galaxies is mostly neutral, the H$_{2}$ formation and cooling
processes are disturbed by mild photoheating. Photodissociating
radiations actually suppress star formation, but the magnitude of the
effect is not so large in massive galaxies. Even though our simulation
volume is too small to be a representative patch of the Universe during
reionization, we find that our simulated star formation rate densities
and H i fractions at z {\tilde} 6-7 are consistent with those found in
observations.

collapsing gas cloud is settled at a given distance from a 120 M

to shield the H$_{2}$ dissociating radiation, leading to the
positive feedback for the secondary Pop III star formation. Also, near
the threshold density, the envelope of gas cloud is stripped
significantly by a shock associated with an ionizing front. By comparing
the mass accretion timescale with the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale, we
estimate the mass of secondary Pop III stars. It turns out that the

	Abstract = {{We present a novel scenario for globular cluster (GC) formation, where
the ultraviolet (UV) background radiation effectively works so as to
produce compact star clusters. Recent observations on the age
distributions of GCs indicate that many GCs formed even after the cosmic
reionization epoch. This implies that a significant fraction of GCs
formed in UV background radiation fields. Also, the star formation in an
early-generation of subgalactic objects may be affected by strong UV
radiation from pre-formed massive stars, e.g. Population III stars.
Here, we explore the formation of GCs in UV radiation fields. For this
purpose, we calculate baryon and dark matter (DM) dynamics in spherical
symmetry, incorporating the self-shielding effects by solving the
radiative transfer of UV radiation. In addition, we prescribe the star
formation in cooled gas components and pursue the dynamics of formed
stars. As a result, we find that the evolution of subgalactic objects in
UV background radiation is separated into three types: (i) prompt star
formation, where less massive clouds
(\~{}10$^{5-8}$M$_{solar}$) are promptly self-shielded and
undergo star formation, (ii) delayed star formation, where photoionized
massive clouds ({\gt}\~{}10$^{8}$M$_{solar}$) collapse despite
high thermal pressure and are eventually self-shielded to form stars in
a delayed fashion, and (iii) supersonic infall, where photoionized less
massive clouds (\~{}10$^{5-8}$M$_{solar}$) contract with
supersonic infall velocity and are self-shielded when a compact core
forms. In particular, the type (iii) is a novel type found in the
present simulations, and eventually produces a very compact star
cluster. The resultant mass-to-light ratios, half-mass radii and
velocity dispersions for the three types are compared to the
observations of GCs, dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) and ultracompact dwarfs
(UCDs). It turns out that the properties of star clusters resulting from
supersonic infall match well with those of observed GCs, whereas the
other two types are distinct from GCs. Hence, we conclude that
supersonic infall in a UV background is a promising mechanism to form
GCs.

Software Environment). We apply this method to star clusters embedded in
the CosmoGrid dark matter only Lambda cold dark matter simulation. Our
star clusters are born at z = 10 (corresponding to an age of the
universe of about 500 Myr) by selecting a dark matter particle and
initializing a star cluster with 32 000 stars on its location. We then
follow the dynamical evolution of the star cluster within the
cosmological environment. We compare the evolution of star clusters in
two Milky Way size haloes with a different accretion history. The
mass-loss of the star clusters is continuous irrespective of the tidal
history of the host halo, but major merger events tend to increase the
rate of mass-loss. From the selected two dark matter haloes, the halo
that experienced the larger number of mergers tends to drive a smaller
mass-loss rate from the embedded star clusters, even though the final
masses of both haloes are similar. We identify two families of star
clusters: native clusters, which become part of the main halo before its
final major merger event, and the immigrant clusters, which are accreted
upon or after this event; native clusters tend to evaporate more quickly
than immigrant clusters. Accounting for the evolution of the dark matter
halo causes immigrant star clusters to retain more mass than when the z
= 0 tidal field is taken as a static potential. The reason for this is
the weaker tidal field experienced by immigrant star clusters before
merging with the larger dark matter halo.

gives reasonable agreement with this dependence. The spin parameter does
not show a correlation with the halo mass. The probability distribution

indicates that the masses are uncertain typically by a factor of about
three.<BR /> Aims: .In this paper, we try to identify the sources and
systematics of this uncertainty.<BR /> Methods: .We characterize the
broad H{$\beta$} emission-line profiles by the ratio of their full-width at
half maximum (FWHM) to their line dispersion, i.e., the second moment of
the line profile. We use this parameter to separate the
reverberation-mapped AGNs into two populations, the first with narrower
H{$\beta$} lines that tend to have relatively extended wings, and the
second with broader lines that are relatively flat-topped. The first
population is characterized by higher Eddington ratios than the second.
Within each population, we calibrate the black-hole mass scale by
comparison of the reverberation-based mass with that predicted by the
bulge velocity dispersion. We also use the distribution of ratios of the
reverberation-based mass to the velocity-dispersion mass prediction in a
comparison with a ''generalized thick disk'' model in order to see if
inclination can plausibly account for the observed distribution.<BR />
Results: .We find that the line dispersion is a less biased parameter in
general than FWHM for black hole mass estimation, although we show that
it is possible to empirically correct for the bias introduced by using
FWHM to characterize the emission-line width. We also argue that
inclination effects are apparent only in some small subset of the
reverberation-based mass measurements; it is primarily the objects with
the narrowest emission lines that seem to be most strongly affected.<BR

sensitive primarily to Eddington ratio, but that inclination effects

(2000) between the size of the Broad Line Region (BLR) of Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and the optical luminosity, to compute their
accretion rates in four samples of AGN, assuming that the optical
luminosity is provided by the accretion disc. We show that Narrow Line
Seyfert Galaxies 1 (NLS1s) accrete at super-Eddington rates, while their
luminosity stays of the order of the Eddington limit. We take into
account the possibility of a non-viscous energy release inversely
proportional to the square of the distance in the gravitationally
unstable region of the disc emitting a fraction of the optical
luminosity. It leads to a smaller accretion rate and to a redder
continuum than a standard disc, which agrees better with the
observations. The observed bolometric luminosities appear to saturate at
a few times the Eddington luminosity for super-Eddington accretion
rates, as predicted by slim disc models. They favor a Kerr BH rather
than a Schwarzschild one. Even when the accretion rate is
super-Eddington, it stays always of the order of a few
M$_{&sun;}$/yr, irrespective of the BH mass, indicating that the
growing of the BH is mass-supply-limited and therefore regulated by an
exterior mechanism, and not Eddington-limited. The mass of the BH
increases by one order of magnitude in a few 10$^{7}$ years, a
time smaller than that necessary for changing the bulge mass. This is in
agreement with recent claims that the BHs of NLS1s do not follow the
same black hole - bulge relation as other galaxies. Since they represent
about 10\% of AGN up to a redshift of 0.5, these ``super-active'' phases
should play an important role in shaping the mass function of local BHs.
We finally discuss the possibility that the masses could be
systematically underestimated due to an inclination effect, and we
conclude that this could indeed be the case, and that the accretion
rates could thus be strongly overestimated in a small fraction of
objects, possibly explaining the existence of apparently extremely high
accretors.

that a black hole (BH) growth by factor of 8-800 happens in these
super-Eddington accretion phase of AGNs. Moreover, there is a possible,
systematic underestimation of accretion rates (in the Eddington unit)
due to an overestimation of BH mass by massive accretion discs for
super-Eddington objects. If it is true, the factor of BH growth above
may be larger by order(s) of magnitude. In contrast, the growth factor
expected in sub-Eddington phase is only {\tilde} 2. Therefore, the cosmic
BH growth by accretion is likely dominated by super-Eddington phase,
rather than sub-Eddington phase which is the majority among AGNs.

This analysis is based on the fraction and the average accretion rate of
NLS1s and NLQs obtained for z {\lsim} 0.5. If those numbers are larger at
higher redshift (where BHs were probably less grown), super-Eddington
accretion would be even more important in the context of cosmic BH

as small as {\tilde} 1500  {\AA} for {$\alpha$} =0.001, which is the
smallest {$\alpha$} case in this study. Therefore, the window for observing
the self-gravitating part of an AGN accretion disc is from {\tilde} 2
{$\mu$}m to {$\lambda$}$_{sg}$. Incidentally, r$_{sg}$ can be less
than the photon trapping radius for M$_{&sun;}$ {\gsim}
10$^{3.3}$ L$_{Edd}$/c$^{2}$. Namely, a
self-gravitating, optically-thick, advection-dominated accretion disc is
expected to appear in the extremely high accretion rate regime.

Next, we demonstrate that the Mid-Infrared to X-ray spectrum of a
bright, well-studied Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy, Ton S 180, is indeed
well fitted by the spectrum arising from the following three components:
an inner slim disc (with a corona), an outer, self-gravitating
non-Keplerian disc and a dusty torus. The total mass, BH mass plus the
entire disc mass, is found to be about (1.4 - 8.0)  M$_{BH}$. If
the surface density varies with radius r in proportion to
r$^{-0.6}$, the total mass is consistent with the central mass
estimated by H$\backslash$beta and [O III] widths.

Chandra Spectrometer (Low Energy Transmission Grating). Several narrow
absorption lines and a few emission disk lines have been successfully
fitted to the data. We have not found any significant edges accompanying

with that of the recent paper by Krolik, in which a warm absorber is
strongly inhomogeneous. Such a situation is possible in the so-called
multiphase medium, where regions with different ionization states,
densities, and temperatures may coexist in thermal equilibrium under
constant pressure. We illustrate this scenario with theoretical spectra
of radiation transferred through a stratified cloud with constant
pressure (instead of constant density) computed by the TITAN code in
plane-parallel approximation. Detected spectral features are faint, and
their presence does not alter the broadband continuum. We model the
broadband continuum of Ton S180 assuming an irradiated accretion disk
with a dissipative warm skin. The set of parameters appropriate for the
data cannot be determined uniquely, but models with low values of the
black hole mass have too hot and radially extended a warm skin to
explain the formation of soft X-ray disk lines seen in the data.

by including different temperatures in ions and electrons as well as
Compton cooling. We found that the mass evaporation rate, and hence the
fraction of accretion energy released in the corona, depend strongly on
the rate of incoming mass flow from the outer edge of the disk, a larger
rate leading to more Compton cooling, less efficient evaporation, and a
weaker corona. We also found a strong dependence on the viscosity, with
higher viscosity leading to an enhanced mass flow in the corona and
therefore more evaporation of gas from the disk below. If we take
accretion rates in units of the Eddington rate, our results become
independent of the mass of the central black hole. The model predicts
weaker contributions to the hard X-rays for objects with higher
accretion rate like narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, in agreement with

cooling in the innermost corona is so efficient that a large amount of
additional heating is required to maintain the corona above the thin

through multiple merging events with less massive galaxies. In addition,
the Magorrian relation indicates that almost all galaxies are occupied
by a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) of mass
10$^{-3}$ times the mass of its spheroidal component.
Consequently, SMBHs are expected to wander in the halos of their host
galaxies following a galaxy collision, although evidence of this
activity is currently lacking. We investigate a current plausible
location of an SMBH wandering in the halo of the Andromeda galaxy (M31).
According to theoretical studies of N-body simulations, some of the many
substructures in the M31 halo are remnants of a minor merger occurring
about 1 Gyr ago. First, to evaluate the possible parameter space of the
infalling orbit of the progenitor, we perform numerous parameter studies
using a graphics processing unit cluster. To reduce uncertainties in the
predicted position of the expected SMBH, we then calculate the time
evolution of the SMBH in the progenitor dwarf galaxy from N-body
simulations using the plausible parameter sets. Our results show that
the SMBH lies within the halo (\~{}20-50 kpc from the M31 center), closer
to the Milky Way than the M31 disk. Furthermore, the predicted current
positions of the SMBH were restricted to an observational field of
0.{\deg}6 {\times} 0.{\deg}7 in the northeast region of the M31 halo. We
also discuss the origin of the infalling orbit of the satellite galaxy

Explorer (RXTE) observations and 8 simultaneous Swift and RXTE
observations. According to the definitions of the spectral states in
Remillard and McClintock (2006, ARA{\amp}A, 44, 49), most of the
observations have been classified into the intermediate state. All of
the X-ray broadband spectra can be modeled by a multi-color disk plus a
power-law with an exponential cutoff or a multi-color disk plus a
Comptonization component. During the initial phase of the outburst, a
high-energy cutoff was visible at 30-40 keV. The innermost radius of the
disk gradually decreased by a factor of more than 3 from the onset of
the outburst, and reached a constant value of 35d$_{10}$cos
i$^{-1/2}$ km, where d$_{10}$ is the distance in units of 10
kpc and i is the inclination. The type-C quasi-periodic oscillation
(QPO) frequency varied from 1.6 Hz to 7.3 Hz in association with a
change of the innermost radius, while the innermost radius remained
constant during the type-B QPO detections at 1.6-4.1 Hz. Hence, we
suggest that the origin of the type-B QPOs is different from that of
type-C QPOs, the latter of which would originate from the disk
truncation radius. Assuming the constant innermost radius in the latter
phase of the outburst as the innermost stable circular orbit, the black
hole mass in MAXI J1659-152 is estimated to be 3.6-8.0M$_{&sun;}$

	Abstract = {{According to recent models, the accretion disk and black hole in active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) are surrounded by a clumpy torus. We investigate
the NIR flux variation of the torus in response to a UV flash for
various geometries. Anisotropic illumination by the disk and the torus
self-occultation contrast our study with earlier works. Both the waning
effect of each clump and the torus self-occultation selectively reduce
the emission from the region with a short delay. Therefore, the NIR
delay depends on the viewing angle (where a more inclined angle leads to
a longer delay), and the time response shows an asymmetric profile with
negative skewness, opposing the results for optically thin tori. The
range of the computed delay coincides with the observed one, suggesting
that the viewing angle is primarily responsible for the scatter of the
observed delay. We also propose that the red NIR-to-optical color of
type 1.8/1.9 objects is caused not only by the dust extinction but also
the intrinsically red color. Compared with the modest torus thickness,
both a thick and a thin tori display weaker NIR emission. A selection
bias is thus expected such that NIR-selected AGNs tend to possess
moderately thick tori. A thicker torus shows a narrower and more heavily
skewed time profile, while a thin torus produces a rapid response. A
super-Eddington accretion rate leads to much weaker NIR emission due to
the disk self-occultation and the disk truncation by self-gravity. A
long delay is expected from an optically thin and/or a largely
misaligned torus. Very weak NIR emission, such as in hot-dust-poor
active nuclei, can arise from a geometrically thin torus, a
super-Eddington accretion rate, or a slightly misaligned torus.

black hole binaries (BHBs), are known to show state transitions similar
to Galactic BHBs. However, the relation between the ULX states and the
Galactic BHB states is still unclear, primarily due to the less
well-understood behaviors of ULXs in contrast to the Galactic BHBs.
Here, we report a statistical X-ray spectral study of 34 energy spectra
from seven bright ULXs in the interacting galaxy systems M 51 and NGC
4490/85, using archive data from multiple Chandra and XMM-Newton
observations spanning a few years. In order to compare them with
Galactic BHB states, we applied representative spectral models of
BHBs{\mdash}a power-law (PL), a multi-color disk blackbody (MCD), and a
slim-disk model{\mdash}to all the ULX spectra. We found a hint of a
bimodal structure in the luminosity distribution of the samples,
suggesting that ULXs have two states that respectively have typical
luminosities of (3-6){\times} 10$^{39}$ and (1.5-3){\times}
10$^{39}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. Most spectra in the brighter state
are explained by the MCD or the slim-disk model, whereas those in the
fainter state are explained by the PL model. In particular, the
slim-disk model successfully explains the observed spectral variations
of NGC 4490/85 ULX-6 and ULX-8 by changes of the mass accretion rate to
a black hole of an estimated mass of {\lt}40 M $_{sun}$. From the
best-fit model parameters of each state, we speculate that the brighter
state in these two ULXs corresponds to the brightest state of Galactic
BHBs, which is often called the ''apparently standard state.'' The fainter
state of the ULXs has a PL-shaped spectrum, but the photon index range
is much wider than that seen in any single state of Galactic BHBs. We
thus speculate that it is a state unique to ULXs. Some sources show much
fainter and steeper spectra than the faint state, which we identified as
yet another state.

galaxies (\~{}700). This huge difference suggests either nonoverlapped
coevolution, a long star formation duration, or a temporarily high
accretion rate during the NLS1 phase.

(NLS1s) that cover all the NLS1s at z{\lt}0.0666 and
{$\delta$}{\gt}=-25$^{deg}$ known in 2001. Among the 50 NLS1s, 40
images are newly obtained by our observations and 10 images are taken
from archive data. Motivated by the hypothesis that NLS1s are in an
early phase of a supermassive black hole (BH) evolution, we present a
study of NLS1 host galaxy morphology to examine trigger mechanism(s) of
active galactic nuclei (AGNs) by seeing the early phase of AGN. With
these images, we made morphological classification by visual inspection
and by quantitative method, and found a high bar frequency of the NLS1s
in the optical band; the bar frequency is 85\%+/-7\% among disk galaxies
(64\%-71\% in total sample) which is more frequent than that (40\%-70\%) of
broad-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (BLS1s) and normal disk galaxies, although
the significance is marginal. Our results confirm the claim by Crenshaw
and coworkers with a similar analysis for 19 NLS1s. The frequency is
comparable to that of H II/starburst galaxies. We also examined the bar
frequency against width of the broad H{$\beta$} emission line, Eddington
ratio, and BH mass, but no clear trend is seen. Possible implications,
such as an evolutionary sequence from NLS1s to BLS1s, are discussed
briefly.

ultraluminous X-ray source M82 X-1 with a 105 ks exposure when the
source was in the steady state. Thanks to the high photon statistics
from the large effective area and long exposure, we were able to
discriminate different X-ray continuum spectral models. Neither the
standard accretion disk model [where the radial dependency of the disk
effective temperature is T(r)\~{}r$^{-3/4}$] nor a power-law model
gives a satisfactory fit. In fact, observed curvature of the M82 X-1
spectrum was just between those of the two models. When the exponent of
the radial dependence [p in T(r)\~{}r$^{-p}$] of the disk temperature
is allowed to be free, we obtained
p=0.61$^{+0.03}$$_{-0.02}$. Such a reduction of p from the
standard value 3/4 under extremely high mass accretion rates is
predicted from the accretion disk theory as a consequence of the radial
energy advection. Thus, the accretion disk in M82 X-1 is considered to
be in the slim-disk state, where an optically thick advection-dominated
accretion flow is taking place. We have applied a theoretical slim-disk
spectral model to M82 X-1 and estimated the black hole mass \~{}19-32
M$_{solar}$. We propose that M82 X-1 is a relatively massive
stellar black hole that has been produced through evolution of an
extremely massive star, shining at a super-Eddington luminosity by
several times the Eddington limit.

	Abstract = {{An open question remains whether Ultraluminous X-ray Sources (ULXs)
really contain intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We carefully
investigated the XMM-Newton EPIC spectra of four ULXs that were claimed
to be strong candidates of IMBHs by several authors. We first tried
fitting by the standard spectral model of disk blackbody (DBB) +
power-law (PL), finding good fits to all of the data, in agreement with
others. We, however, found that the PL component dominates the DBB
component at {\tilde}0.3 to 10keV. Thus, the black hole parameters
derived solely from the minor DBB component are questionable. Next, we
tried to fit the same data by the ``p-free disk model'' without the PL
component, assuming an effective temperature profile of T$_{eff}$
{\prop} r$^{-p}$, where r is the disk radius. Interestingly, in
spite of one less free-model parameter, we obtained similarly good fits
with much higher innermost disk temperatures, 1.8 {\lt} kT$_{in}$
{\lt} 3.2keV. More importantly, we obtained p {\tilde} 0.5, just the value
predicted by the slim (super-critical) disk theory, rather than p = 0.75
that is expected from the standard disk model. The estimated black hole
masses from the p-free disk model are much smaller; M lesssim
40M$_{odot}$. Furthermore, we applied a more sophisticated
slim-disk model by Kawaguchi (2003, ApJ, 593, 69), and obtained good
fits with roughly consistent black hole masses. We thus conclude that
the central engines of these ULXs are super-critical accretion flows to
stellar-mass black holes.

accretion disks around Galactic black-holes are reviewed. Historically,
a simple phenomenological accretion disk model has been used to
interpret X-ray observations. Although such a phenomenological
interpretation is still useful, high quality X-ray data from
contemporary instruments allow us to test more realistic accretion disk
models. In a simple and ideal case, the standard optically thick
accretion disk model is successful to explain observations, such that
the inner disk radius is constant at three times the Schwarzschild
radius over large luminosity variations. However, when disk luminosity
is close to or exceeds the Eddington luminosity, the standard disk model
breaks, and we have to consider the ''slim disk'' solution in which radial
energy advection is dominant. Recent observations of Ultra-luminous
X-ray sources (ULXs), which may not be explained by the standard disk
model, strongly suggest the slim disk solution. We compare theoretical
X-ray spectra from the slim disk with observed X-ray spectra of ULXs. We
have found that the slim disk model is successful to explain ULX
spectra, in terms of the massive stellar black-holes with several tens
of solar mass and the super-Eddington mass accretion rates. In order to
explain the large luminosities ({\gt}10 $^{40}$ ergs s
$^{-1}$) of ULXs, ''intermediate black-holes'' ({\gt}100

black-holes of up to several tens of solar mass would naturally explain
the observed properties of ULXs.

suggest that the Eddington ratio is a necessary condition for [O III]
blueshifts or that the [O III] blueshifts weakly depend on the Eddington

electron scattering (opacity and Comptonization) and the relativistic
correction (gravitational redshift and transverse Doppler effect) on the
emergent spectra from super-Eddington accretion flows onto nonrotating
BHs are examined for 10$^{1.5}$ and 10$^{6.5}$
M$_{solar}$ BH masses (M$_{BH}$). With
m[{\equiv}M/(L$_{Edd}$/c$^{2}$)]{\gt}=100 (where M is the

is {\lt}\~{}2.3-6.5. As a result of the m-sensitive hardening factor, the
color temperature of the innermost radiation is not proportional to
L$^{0.25}$, differing from the simplest standard accretion disk.
The model is applied to optical-soft X-ray emission from NLS1s. We pick
up one NLS1, namely, PG 1448+273 with an inferred M$_{BH}$ of
10$^{6.4}$ M$_{solar}$, among the highest m candidates. The
broadband spectral distribution is successfully reproduced by the model
with an extremely high m (=1000) and the viscosity parameter {$\alpha$} of
0.01. This implies that this object, as well as some other highest m
systems, is really young: the inferred age, M$_{BH}$/M, is about
10$^{6}$ yr. We also briefly discuss the distribution of m for
transient and highly variable NLS1s, finding that those are located at
3{\lt}\~{}m{\lt}\~{}300. Such a moderately high accretion rate is indicative of
thermal instability. Furthermore, m for a possible type 2 counterpart of

and that a disk shines nearly at the Eddington luminosity, L\_E. Then,
the disk becomes a slim disk and exhibits the following distinctive
signatures: (1) The disk luminosity (particularly of X-rays) is
insensitive to the mass-flow rates, dot M, since the generated energy is
partly carried away to the black hole by trapped photons in accretion
flow. (2) The spectra are multi-color blackbody. The maximum blackbody

the size of the blackbody emitting region is small, r\_bb {\lt}\~{} 3 r\_S

	Abstract = {{We propose a new method to explore the candidate super-Eddington active
galactic nuclei (AGNs). We examine the properties of infrared (IR)
emission from the inner edge of the dusty torus in AGNs, which are
powered by super- or sub-Eddington accretion flows around black holes,
by considering the dependence of the polar angle on the radiation flux
of accretion flows. We find that for super-Eddington AGNs, of which the
mass accretion rate is more than 10$^{2}$ times larger than the
Eddington rate, the ratio of the AGN IR luminosity and the disc
bolometric luminosity is less than 10$^{-2}$, unless the half
opening angle of the torus ({\thetas}$_{torus}$) is small
({\thetas}$_{torus}$ {\lt} 65{\deg}). This is due to the
self-occultation effect, whereby the self-absorption at the outer region
of the super-Eddington flow dilutes the illumination of the torus. Such
a small luminosity ratio is not observed in sub-Eddington AGNs, whose
mass accretion rate is comparable to or no more than 10 times larger
than the Eddington mass accretion rate, except for extremely thin tori
({\thetas}$_{torus}$ {\gt} 85{\deg}). We also consider the properties
of the near-IR (NIR) emission radiated from hot dust {\gt}1000 K. We find
that super-Eddington AGNs have a ratio of the NIR luminosity to the
bolometric luminosity, L$_{NIR, AGN}$/L$_{bol, disc}$, at
least one order of magnitude smaller than for sub-Eddington AGNs for a
wide range of half opening angle ({\thetas}$_{torus}$ {\gt}
65{\deg}), for various types of dusty torus model. Thus, a relatively low
L$_{NIR, AGN}$/L$_{bol, disc}$ is a property that allows
identification of candidate super-Eddington AGNs. Lastly, we discuss the
possibility that NIR-faint quasars at redshift z{\tilde} 6 discovered by
a recent deep Sloan Digital Sky Survey may be young quasars whose black
holes grow via super-Eddington accretion.

	Abstract = {{Motivated by the recent observational and theoretical evidence that long
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are likely associated with low metallicity,
rapidly rotating massive stars, we examine the cosmological star
formation rate (SFR) below a critical metallicity Z$_{crit}$ \~{}
1/10-1/5Z$_{solar}$, to estimate the event rate of high redshift
long GRB progenitors. To this purpose, we exploit a galaxy formation
scenario already successfully tested on a wealth of observational data
on (proto)spheroids, Lyman break galaxies, Lyman {$\alpha$} emitters, submm
galaxies, quasars and local early-type galaxies. We find that the
predicted rate of long GRBs amounts to about 300 events yr$^{-1}$
sr$^{-1}$, of which about 30 per cent occur at z {\gt}\~{} 6.
Correspondingly, the GRB number counts well agree with the bright SWIFT
data, without the need for an intrinsic luminosity evolution. Moreover,
the above framework enables us to predict the properties of the GRB host
galaxies. Most GRBs are associated with low-mass galaxy haloes
M$_{H}$ {\lt}\~{} 10$^{11}$M$_{solar}$, and effectively
trace the formation of small galaxies in such haloes. The hosts are
young, with age smaller than 5 {\times} 10$^{7}$ yr, gas rich, but
poorly extincted (A$_{V}$ {\lt}\~{} 0.1) because of their chemical
immaturity; this also implies high specific SFR and quite extreme
{$\alpha$}-enhancement. Only the minority of hosts residing in large haloes
with M$_{H}$ {\gt}\~{} 10$^{12}$M$_{solar}$ has larger
extinction (A$_{V}$ \~{} 0.7 - 1), SFRs exceeding
100M$_{solar}$yr$^{-1}$ and can be detected at submm
wavelengths. Most of the hosts have ultraviolet magnitudes in the range
-20 {\lt}\~{} M$_{1350}$ {\lt}\~{} -16, and Lyman {$\alpha$} luminosity in
the range 2 {\times} 10$^{40}$ {\lt}\~{} L$_{Lymanα}$ {\lt}\~{}
2 {\times} 10$^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$. GRB hosts are thus tracing
the faint end of the luminosity function of Lyman break galaxies and
Lyman {$\alpha$} emitters. Finally, our results imply that the population
of `dark' GRBs occur mostly in faint hosts at high redshift, rather than
in dusty hosts at low redshift.

radio-loud AGNs that considers radio galaxies as non-beamed parent
populations of blazars. Five of the six NLS1s have (1) extended radio
luminosities suggesting jet kinetic powers of {\gt}\~{} 10$^{44}$ erg

be driven by black holes of {\lt}\~{} 10$^{7}$ M $_{&sun;}$ in

	Abstract = {{Based on the physical model of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth
via gas accretion in a circumnuclear disk (CND) proposed by Kawakatu
{\amp} Wada, we describe the formation of high-z (z{\gt}6) quasars (QSOs)
whose BH masses are M $_{BH}${\gt}10$^{9}$ M $_{sun}$.
We derive the necessary conditions to form QSOs at z{\gt}6 by only gas
accretion: (1) a large mass supply with M
$_{sup}${\gt}10$^{10}$ M $_{sun}$from host galaxies to
CNDs, because the final BH mass is only 1\%-10\% of the total supplied
mass from QSO hosts. (2) High star formation efficiency for a rapid BH
growth which is comparable to high-z starburst galaxies such as
submillimeter galaxies. We also find that if the BH growth is limited by
the Eddington accretion, the final BH mass is greatly suppressed when
the period of mass supply from hosts, t $_{sup}$, is shorter than
the Eddington timescale. Thus, the super-Eddington growth is required
for the QSO formation while t $_{sup}$, which is determined by the
efficiency of angular momentum transfer, is shorter than \~{}10$^{8}$
yr. The evolution of the QSO luminosity depends on the redshift z
$_{i}$ at which accretion onto a seed BH is initiated. In other
words, the brighter QSOs at z{\gt}6 favor the late growth of SMBHs (i.e.,
z $_{i}$ {\ap} 10) rather than early growth (i.e., z $_{i}$
{\ap} 30). For z $_{i}$ {\ap} 10, t $_{sup}$ sime
10$^{8}$ yr is shorter than that of the star formation in the CND.
Thus, the gas in the CND can accrete onto a BH more efficiently,
compared with the case for z $_{i}$ {\ap} 30 (or t $_{sup}$
{\ap} 10$^{9}$ yr). Moreover, we predict the observable properties
and the evolution of QSOs at z{\gt}6. In a QSO phase, there should exist
a stellar rich massive CND, whose gas mass is about 10\% of the dynamical
mass inside \~{}0.1-1 kpc. On the other hand, in a phase where the BH grows
(i.e., a proto-QSO phase), the proto-QSO has a gas-rich massive CND
whose gas mass is comparable to the dynamical mass. Compared with the
observed properties of the distant QSO SDSS J1148+5251 observed at z =
6.42, we predict that SDSS J1148+5251 corresponds to the scenario of the
late growth of SMBH with z $_{i}$ \~{} 10, which is accompanied by a
massive CNDs with M $_{g}$ {\ap} 5 {\times} 10$^{10}$ M
$_{sun}$ and the luminous nuclear starburst L $_{SB}$at
infrared band with L $_{SB}$ {\ap} 10$^{47}$ erg
s$^{-1}$. Moreover, we predict that the progenitor of SDSS
J1148+5251 can be the super-Eddington object. These predictions can be
verified by ALMA, SPICA, and JWST.

ascribed to the change of the power-law index of ambient density profile

becomes nearly spherical or disrupted for MSOs, while an elongated
morphology is predicted for CSOs and FR II galaxies. This seems to be
consistent with the higher fraction of distorted morphology of MSOs than
that of CSOs and FR II galaxies. Finally, we predict that only CSOs

delay of \~{}10$^{8}$ yr. Through this evolution, the gas-rich CND
turns into the gas-poor stellar disk. We found that not all the gas
supplied from the host galaxy to the central 100 pc region accretes onto
the SMBH even in the high-accretion phase (mode [i]), because part of
the gas is used to form stars. Outflow from the circumnuclear region
also suppresses the growth of the SMBH. As a result, the final SMBH mass
(M$_{BH,final}$) is not proportional to the total gas mass
supplied from the host galaxy (M$_{sup}$);
M$_{BH,final}$/M$_{sup}$ decreases with M$_{sup}$.
This would indicate that it is difficult to form a SMBH with
\~{}10$^{9}$ M$_{solar}$ observed for high-z quasi-stellar
objects. The evolution of the SMBH and CND would be related to the
evolutionary tracks of different types of AGNs. We find that the AGN
luminosity tightly correlates with the luminosity of the nuclear
starburst only in the high-accretion phase (mode [ii]). This implies
that the AGN-starburst connection depends on the evolution of the AGN
activity.

of such massive tori would cast light on a key physical condition that
allows the rapid growth of SMBHs and the appearance of QSOs at high

Our work shows that ALMA will be able to resolve and detect high-J

QSOs tended to show a sub-Eddington flow. On the basis of our findings,
we suggest that a central SMBH grows by changing its mass accretion rate

been predicted that a self-gravitating massive torus, whose mass is
larger than a central BH, exists in the early phase of BH growth (type 1

ULIRGs have systematically smaller BH masses in spite of the comparable

recently revealed that their X-ray properties are similar to those of
the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. These would indicate that active

As a result, it is found that after a galactic wind epoch, the
luminosity is shifted from the host-dominant phase to the active
galactic nucleus-dominant phase (QSO phase) in the timescale of a few
10$^{8}$ yr. The former phase corresponds to the early stage of a
growing BH and can be regarded as a ``proto-QSO'' phase. It has
observable characteristic properties as follows: (1) The broad emission
lines are narrower than those of ordinary QSOs and are typically less
than 1500 km s$^{-1}$. (2) The BH-to-bulge mass ratio,
M$_{BH}$/M$_{bulge}$, is in the range of 10$^{-5.3}$
to 10$^{-3.9}$. (3) Host galaxies are bluer than QSO hosts, by
about 0.5 mag in the colors B-V at the rest bands and V-K at the
observed bands, with assumed galaxy formation redshifts of
z$_{f}$=3-5. (4) The metallicity of gas in the galactic nuclei is
\~{}8 Z$_{solar}$ and that of stars weighted by the host luminosity
is \~{}3 Z$_{solar}$. (5) The central massive BH (\~{}=10$^{7}$
M$_{solar}$) is surrounded by a massive dusty disk
({\gt}10$^{8}$ M$_{solar}$), which may obscure the nucleus in
the edge-on view and make a type 2 nucleus. By comparing these

candidate for proto-QSOs. Also, it is anticipated that the proto-QSO
phase is preceded by an optically thick phase, which may correspond to
ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). In this phase,
M$_{BH}$/M$_{bulge}$ is predicted to be much less than

numerically solve the relativistic radiation hydrodynamical equation

the density distributions of the interstellar medium (ISM). The
efficiency drops according to {$\tau$}T-2 in an optically thick uniform
ISM, where {$\tau$}$_{T}$ is the total optical depth of the dusty

the ISM is clumpy. Hence, if bulge formation begins with a star

work to remove the angular momentum and the accreted gas may form a

	Abstract = {{We investigate the properties of massive, dense clouds formed in a
barred galaxy and their possible relation to star formation, performing
a two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation with the gravitational
potential obtained from the 2MASS data from the barred spiral galaxy,
M83. Since the environment for cloud formation and evolution in the bar
region is expected to be different from that in the spiral arm region,
barred galaxies are a good target to study the environmental effects on
cloud formation and the subsequent star formation. Our simulation uses
for an initial 80 Myr isothermal flow of non-self gravitating gas in the
barred potential, then including radiative cooling, heating and
self-gravitation of the gas for the next 40 Myr, during which dense
clumps are formed. We identify many cold, dense gas clumps for which the
mass is more than 10$^{4}$ M$_{&sun;}$ (a value
corresponding to the molecular clouds) and study the physical properties
of these clumps. The relation of the velocity dispersion of the
identified clump's internal motion with the clump size is similar to
that observed in the molecular clouds of our Galaxy. We find that the
virial parameters for clumps in the bar region are larger than that in
the spiral arm region. From our numerical results, we estimate star
formation in the bar and spiral arm regions by applying the simple model
of Krumholz {\amp} McKee (2005). The mean relation between star
formation rate and gas surface density agrees well with the observed
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. The star formation efficiency in the bar
region is {\tilde}60 per cent of the spiral arm region. This trend is
consistent with observations of barred galaxies.

	Abstract = {{We investigate the gas supply process from a nuclear gas disk to the
Galactic center by performing two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations
including self-gravity and radiative cooling. We assume that the gas is
supplied to the nuclear gas disk by the host galaxy disk. We show that
many gas clumps are formed in the nuclear gas disk after the nuclear gas
disk becomes massive enough to become gravitationally unstable.
Coalescence of the gas clumps leads to the formation of more massive gas
clumps. Gravitational encounters between these massive gas clumps induce
angular momentum transfer between the gas clumps. Massive gas clumps
that lose their angular momentum due to gravitational encounters move to
the galactic center. In this way, the gas supply to the galactic center
is realized. We also perform a numerical simulation with twice the
spatial resolution to check numerical resolution effects. Time evolution
of azimuthally averaged surface density distributions in both models
agree well with each other. The high-mass part of the clump mass
function in the low-resolution model is in good agreement with that of
the high-resolution model, and lower mass clumps are well resolved in
the high-resolution model. Therefore, we conclude that massive gas
clumps play a major role in the angular momentum transfer. The gas
supply rate to the center is about half of the gas supply rate from the
host galaxy when the whole region of the nuclear gas disk becomes
self-gravitationally unstable. More massive gas clumps are formed and
migrate to the Galactic center in the models of the higher gas supply
rate from the host galaxy.

the power-law index of the mass-density profile of the dark matter (DM)

any mass-loss model. Moreover, for the slow mass-loss case, the final
density profile of the DM halo recovers the universal density profiles

to simulate the formation of a galaxy in the {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter
structure formation paradigm. The various runs (13 in total) differ in
their numerical hydrodynamical treatment [smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH), moving mesh and adaptive mesh refinement] but share
the same initial conditions and adopt in each case their latest
published model of gas cooling, star formation and feedback. Despite the
common halo assembly history, we find large code-to-code variations in
the stellar mass, size, morphology and gas content of the galaxy at z=
0, due mainly to the different implementations of star formation and
feedback. Compared with observation, most codes tend to produce an
overly massive galaxy, smaller and less gas rich than typical spirals,
with a massive bulge and a declining rotation curve. A stellar disc is
discernible in most simulations, although its prominence varies widely
from code to code. There is a well-defined trend between the effects of
feedback and the severity of the disagreement with observed spirals. In
general, models that are more effective at limiting the baryonic mass of
the galaxy come closer to matching observed galaxy scaling laws, but
often to the detriment of the disc component. Although numerical
convergence is not particularly good for any of the codes, our
conclusions hold at two different numerical resolutions. Some
differences can also be traced to the different numerical techniques;
for example, more gas seems able to cool and become available for star
formation in grid-based codes than in SPH. However, this effect is small
compared to the variations induced by different feedback prescriptions.
We conclude that state-of-the-art simulations cannot yet uniquely
predict the properties of the baryonic component of a galaxy, even when
the assembly history of its host halo is fully specified. Developing
feedback algorithms that can effectively regulate the mass of a galaxy
without hindering the formation of high angular momentum stellar discs
remains a challenge.

smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of a Milky Way (MW)
like system, focusing on the best resolved examples, analogous to the
classical MW satellites. Comparing with a pure dark matter simulation,
we find that the condensation of baryons has had a relatively minor
effect on the structure of the satellites' dark matter haloes. The
stellar mass that forms in each satellite agrees relatively well over
three levels of resolution (a factor of {\tilde}64 in particle mass) and
scales with (sub)halo mass in a similar way in an independent
semi-analytical model. Our model provides a relatively good match to the
average luminosity function of the MW and M31. To establish whether the
potential wells of our satellites are realistic, we measure their masses
within observationally determined half-light radii, finding that they
have somewhat higher mass-to-light ratios than those derived for the MW
dSphs from stellar kinematic data; the most massive examples are most
discrepant. A statistical test yields an {\tilde}6 per cent probability
that the simulated and observationally derived distributions of masses
are consistent. If the satellite population of the MW is typical, our
results could imply that feedback processes not properly captured by our

they initially formed with lower concentrations, as would be the case,

	Abstract = {{We have developed a numerical software library for collisionless N-body
simulations named ''Phantom-GRAPE'' which highly accelerates force
calculations among particles by use of a new SIMD instruction set
extension to the x86 architecture, Advanced Vector eXtensions (AVX), an
enhanced version of the Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE). In our library,
not only the Newton's forces, but also central forces with an arbitrary
shape f(r), which has a finite cutoff radius r$_{cut}$ (i.e.
f(r)=0 at r{\gt}r$_{cut}$), can be quickly computed. In computing
such central forces with an arbitrary force shape f(r), we refer to a
pre-calculated look-up table. We also present a new scheme to create the
look-up table whose binning is optimal to keep good accuracy in
computing forces and whose size is small enough to avoid cache misses.
Using an Intel Core i7-2600 processor, we measure the performance of our
library for both of the Newton's forces and the arbitrarily shaped
central forces. In the case of Newton's forces, we achieve
2{\times}10$^{9}$ interactions per second with one processor core
(or 75 GFLOPS if we count 38 operations per interaction), which is 20
times higher than the performance of an implementation without any
explicit use of SIMD instructions, and 2 times than that with the SSE
instructions. With four processor cores, we obtain the performance of
8{\times}10$^{9}$ interactions per second (or 300 GFLOPS). In the
case of the arbitrarily shaped central forces, we can calculate
1{\times}10$^{9}$ and 4{\times}10$^{9}$ interactions per
second with one and four processor cores, respectively. The performance
with one processor core is 6 times and 2 times higher than those of the
implementations without any use of SIMD instructions and with the SSE
instructions. These performances depend only weakly on the number of
particles, irrespective of the force shape. It is good contrast with the
fact that the performance of force calculations accelerated by graphics
processing units (GPUs) depends strongly on the number of particles.
Substantially weak dependence of the performance on the number of
particles is suitable to collisionless N-body simulations, since these
simulations are usually performed with sophisticated N-body solvers such
as Tree- and TreePM-methods combined with an individual timestep scheme.
We conclude that collisionless N-body simulations accelerated with our
library have significant advantage over those accelerated by GPUs,
especially on massively parallel environments.

	Abstract = {{More than half of nearby disc galaxies have pseudo-bulges, instead of
classical bulges that are thought to be end-products of galaxy mergers.
Pseudo-bulges are presumed to develop over time as a result of the
secular evolution of galaxy discs. We report on simulations of galaxy
formation, in which two disc galaxies with discy pseudo-bulges have
formed. Based on the profile decomposition, the bulge-to-total mass
ratio of the simulated galaxies is 0.6 for one galaxy and 0.3 for the
other. We find that the main formation mechanism of the pseudo-bulges in
our simulations is not the secular evolution of discs but high-redshift
starbursts. The progenitors of the pseudo-bulges form as high-redshift
discs with small scalelengths by the rapid supply of low angular
momentum gas. By redshift 2, before the main disc formation,
pseudo-bulge formation has largely completed in terms of mass. The
secular evolution, such as bar instability, accounts for about 30 per
cent of the bulge mass for one galaxy and only {\tilde}13 per cent for
the other. However, it does affect the final shape and kinematic
properties of the pseudo-bulges.

radiative transfer calculation around point sources within a
three-dimensional Cartesian grid by using the oct-tree structure for the
distribution of radiation sources. In one prescription, distant
radiation sources are grouped as a bright extended source when the
group's angular size, {\thetas}$_{s}$, is smaller than a critical
value, {\thetas}$_{crit}$, and radiative transfer is solved on
supermeshes whose angular size is similar to that of the group of
sources. The supermesh structure is constructed by coarse-graining the
mesh structure. With this method, the computational time scales with
N$_{m}$log (N$_{m}$)log (N$_{s}$), where N$_{m}$
and N$_{s}$ are the number of meshes and that of radiation
sources, respectively. While this method is very efficient, it
inevitably overestimates the optical depth when a group of sources acts
as an extended powerful radiation source and affects distant meshes. In
the other prescription, a distant group of sources is treated as a
bright point source ignoring the spatial extent of the group, and the
radiative transfer is solved on the meshes rather than the supermeshes.
This prescription is simply a grid-based version of START by Hasegawa
{\amp} Umemura and yields better results in general with slightly more
computational cost [?] than the supermesh prescription. Our methods can
easily be implemented to any grid-based hydrodynamic codes and are well
suited to adaptive mesh refinement methods.

These massive and compact clusters are consistent with the

satellite galaxies are very sensitive to heating processes which affect
their gas content. Their properties can therefore be used to constrain
the nature of feedback processes that regulate galaxy formation. In our
simulations, we assume that all the energy produced by supernovae is
used as kinetic energy to drive galactic winds. Several of our
simulations produce bright, disc-dominated galaxies. We find that wind
models in which the wind speed, v$_{w}$, is proportional to the
local velocity dispersion of the dark matter, (and thus the wind
mass-loading, ), make star formation in satellites sporadic, reproduce
the observed satellite luminosity function reasonably well (down to
M$_{v}$=-7) and match the luminosity-metallicity relation observed
in the Local Group satellites. By contrast, models that assume a
constant wind speed overproduce faint satellites and predict an
incorrect luminosity-metallicity relation. Our simulations therefore
suggest that the feedback processes that operate on the scale of
satellite galaxies should generate galactic outflows whose mass-loading

of thousands of well-resolved haloes in the Millennium Simulation of
Springel et al. and in a smaller, but higher resolution, simulation, in
total spanning 5 orders of magnitude in mass. For haloes of a given
mass, the median specific angular momentum increases with radius as
j({\lt}=r) \~{} r. The direction of the vector varies considerably with
radius: the median angle between the inner ({\lt}\~{}0.25R$_{vir}$)
and total ({\lt}=R$_{vir}$) angular momentum vectors is about
25{\deg}. To investigate how baryons affect halo spin, we use another
high-resolution simulation, which includes gas cooling, star formation
and feedback. This simulation produces a sample of galaxies with a
realistic distribution of disc-to-total ratios, D/T: two-thirds of the
galaxies have D/T {\gt} 0.5 in the B band. The formation of the galaxy
spins up the dark matter within 0.1R$_{vir}$ such that the
specific halo angular momentum increases by \~{}50 per cent in the median.
The dark matter angular momentum becomes better aligned, but there
remains a broad distribution of (mis-)alignments between the halo and
the central galaxy, with a median angle between their angular momenta of

the halo: half of them have their minor axes misaligned by more than
45{\deg}, although only about 10 per cent of the galaxies lie within
30{\deg} of the plane perpendicular to the major axis of their halo.
Finally, we align a sample of haloes according to the orientation of
their galaxies and stack the projected mass distributions. Although the
individual haloes are significantly aspherical, galaxy-halo
misalignments produce a stacked mass distribution that cannot be
distinguished from circular. If the lack of alignment found in our

the PDF, and then it moves to higher densities (n$_{H}$ gtrsim 100

takes place. After the starburst, the PDF goes back to a quasi-steady

	Abstract = {{We investigate the evolution of angular momentum in simulations of
galaxy formation in a cold dark matter universe. We analyse two model
galaxies generated in the N-body/hydrodynamic simulations of Okamoto et
al. Starting from identical initial conditions, but using different
assumptions for the baryonic physics, one of the simulations produced a
bulge-dominated galaxy and the other one a disc-dominated galaxy. The
main difference is the treatment of star formation and feedback, both of
which were designed to be more efficient in the disc-dominated object.
We find that the specific angular momentum of the disc-dominated galaxy
tracks the evolution of the angular momentum of the dark matter halo
very closely: the angular momentum grows as predicted by linear theory
until the epoch of maximum expansion and remains constant thereafter. By
contrast, the evolution of the angular momentum of the bulge-dominated
galaxy resembles that of the central, most bound halo material: it also
grows at first according to linear theory, but 90 per cent of it is
rapidly lost as pre-galactic fragments, into which gas had cooled
efficiently, merge, transferring their orbital angular momentum to the
outer halo by tidal effects. The disc-dominated galaxy avoids this fate
because the strong feedback reheats the gas, which accumulates in an
extended hot reservoir and only begins to cool once the merging activity
has subsided. Our analysis lends strong support to the classical theory
of disc formation whereby tidally torqued gas is accreted into the
centre of the halo conserving its angular momentum.

	Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new implementation of feedback due to active
galactic nuclei (AGN) in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation.
We assume that a fraction of jet energy, which is generated by an AGN,
is transferred to the surrounding gas as thermal energy. Combining a
theoretical model of mass accretion on to black holes with a multiphase
description of star-forming gas, we self-consistently follow evolution
of both galaxies and their central black holes. The novelty in our model
is that we consider two distinct accretion modes: standard radiatively
efficient thin accretion discs and radiatively inefficient accretion
flows which we will generically refer to as RIAFs; motivated by
theoretical models for jet production in accretion discs, we assume that
only the RIAF is responsible for the AGN feedback. The focus of this
paper is to investigate the interplay between galaxies and their central
black holes during the formation of a disc galaxy. We find that, after
an initial episode of bursting star formation, the accretion rate on to
the central black hole drops so that the accretion disc switches to a
RIAF structure. At this point, the feedback from the AGN becomes
efficient and slightly suppresses star formation in the galactic disc
and almost completely halts star formation in the bulge. This
suppression of the star formation regulates mass accretion on to the
black hole and associated AGN feedback. As a result, the nucleus becomes
a stochastically fuelled low-luminosity AGN (Seyfert galaxy) with
recurrent short-lived episodes of activity after the star bursts. During
the `on' events, the AGN produces reasonably powerful jets (radio-loud
state) and is less luminous than the host galaxy, while in the `off'
phase, the nucleus is inactive and `radio quiet'. Our model predicts
several properties of the low-luminosity AGN including the bolometric
luminosity, jet powers, the effect on kpc scale of the radio jet and the
AGN lifetime, which are in broad agreement with observations of Seyfert
galaxies and their radio activity. We also find that the ratios between
the central black hole mass and the mass of the host spheroid at z = 0
are \~{}10$^{-3}$ regardless of the strength of either supernova
feedback or AGN feedback because the radiation drag model directly
relates the star formation activity in the Galactic Centre and the mass
accretion rate on to the central black hole.

molecular clouds are formed and destroyed. In the model, clouds form
from thermally unstable ambient gas and get destroyed by feedback from
massive stars and thermal conduction. Feedback in the ambient phase
cycles gas into a hot galactic fountain or wind. We model the ambient
gas hydrodynamically using smoothed particle hydrodynamics. However, we
cannot resolve the Jeans mass in the cold and dense molecular gas and,
therefore, represent the cloud phase with ballistic particles that
coagulate when colliding. We show that this naturally produces a
multiphase medium with cold clouds, a warm disc, hot supernova bubbles
and a hot, tenuous halo. Our implementation of this model is based on
the GADGET N-body code. We illustrate the model by evolving an isolated
Milky Way-like galaxy and study the properties of a disc formed in a
rotating spherical collapse. Many observed properties of disc galaxies

two out of three systems with sufficiently large satellite populations,
the satellite system is nearly perpendicular to the plane of the

Our analysis on the formation and evolution of the galaxy and its

the Einstein-de Sitter universe is still a good approximation for the
recently favored {$\Lambda$}-dominated universe, and thus our results do

of the cooling, each clump immediately forms a ``core-halo'' structure
that consists of a baryonic core and a dark matter halo. The tidal force
from the host galaxy mainly strips the dark matter halo from clumps, and
as a result, these clumps get dominated by baryons. Once a clump is
captured by the host halo, its mass drastically decreases with each
pericenter passage. At z=2, more than half of the clumps become

filamentary structures around the clusters, extending out to {\gt} 5 Mpc
from the cores, as well as complex inner structures. The galaxy
distributions in the inner regions of the clusters look similar to the
X-ray intensity maps, suggesting that most of the optical structures
trace physically bound systems. We also compared the structures of the
three clusters with those of model clusters in a numerical simulation
(N-body + semi-analytic model) by parameterising the shapes of the
iso-density contours of galaxies, and found a broad agreement. Our
results that cluster-scale assembly takes place along filaments during
hierarchical clustering need to be confirmed spectroscopically in the
near future.

	Abstract = {{We investigate the evolution of angular momentum in smoothed particle
hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations of galaxy formation, paying particular
attention to artificial numerical effects. We find that a cold gas disc
forming in an ambient hot gas halo receives a strong hydrodynamic torque
from the hot gas. By splitting the hydrodynamic force into artificial
viscosity and pressure gradients, we find that the angular momentum
transport is caused not by the artificial viscosity but by the pressure
gradients. Using simple test simulations of shear flows, we conclude
that the pressure gradient-based viscosity can be divided into two
components: one due to the noisiness of SPH and the other due to ram
pressure. The former is problematic even with very high resolution,
because increasing the resolution does not reduce the noisiness. On the
other hand, the ram pressure effect appears only when a cold gas disc or
sheet does not contain enough particles. In such a case, holes form in
the disc or sheet, and then ram pressure from intra-hole hot gas causes
significant deceleration. In simulations of galactic disc formation,
star formation usually decreases the number of cold gas particles, and
hole formation leads to the fragmentation of the disc. This
fragmentation not only induces further angular momentum transport, but
also affects star formation in the disc. To circumvent these problems,
we modify the SPH algorithm, decoupling the cold gas phases from the hot
ones, i.e. inhibiting the hydrodynamic interaction between cold and hot
particles. This, a crude modelling of a multiphase fluid in SPH
cosmological simulations, leads to the formation of smooth extended cold
gas discs and to better numerical convergence. The decoupling is
applicable in so far as the self-gravitating gas disc with negligible
external pressure is a good approximation for a cold gas disc.

	Abstract = {{We investigate environmental effects on evolution of bright cluster
galaxies (L{\gt}L$_{*}$) in a {$\Lambda$}-dominated cold dark matter
universe using a combination of dissipationless N-body simulations and a
semianalytic galaxy formation model. The N-body simulations enable us to
calculate orbits of galaxies in simulated clusters. Therefore, we can
incorporate stripping of cold gas from galactic disks by ram pressure
(RP) from the intracluster medium into our model. In this paper we study
how ram pressure stripping (RPS) and small starburst induced by a minor
merger affect colors, star formation rates (SFRs), and morphologies of
cluster galaxies. These processes are new ingredients in our model and
have not been studied sufficiently. We find that the RPS is not
important for colors and SFRs of galaxies in the cluster core if the
star formation timescale is properly chosen, because the star formation
is sufficiently suppressed by consumption of the cold gas in the disks.
Then observed color and SFR gradients can be reproduced without the RPS.
The small starburst triggered by a minor merger hardly affects the SFRs
and colors of the galaxies as well. We also examine whether these two
processes can resolve the known problem that the hierarchical clustering
models based on the major merger-driven bulge formation scenario predict
too few galaxies of intermediate bulge-to-total luminosity ratio (B/T)
in clusters. When the minor burst is taken into account, the
intermediate B/T population is increased, and the observed morphology
gradients in clusters are successfully reproduced. Without the minor
burst, the RPS cannot increase the intermediate B/T population. On the
other hand, when the minor burst is considered, the RPS also plays an
important role in formation of the intermediate B/T galaxies. We present
redshift evolution of morphological fractions predicted by our models.
The predicted number ratios of the intermediate B/T galaxies to the
bulge-dominated galaxies show nearly flat or slightly increasing trends
with increasing redshift. We conclude that these trends are inevitable
when bulges are formed through mergers. We discuss whether our results
conflict with observationally suggested N$_{S0}$/N$_{E}$
evolution in clusters, which is a decreasing function of redshift.

similar to that obtained in the field region and agrees well with the
Press-Schechter mass function. (2) The mass function of cluster galaxies

hardly evolved since z\~{}=2. This mass function at z=0 is well represented
by the Press-Schechter mass function at z=2. (3) At high redshift

high calculation cost. We have simulated dynamical evolution of small N
clusters (10$^{4}$ {\lsim} N {\lsim} 10$^{5}$), and have

properties on N. BBHs escape from a cluster at each two-body relaxation
time at a rate proportional to N. Semimajor axes of BBH escapers are
inversely proportional to N, if initial mass densities of clusters are
fixed. Eccentricities, primary masses and mass ratios of BBH escapers
are independent of N. Using this dependence of BBH properties, we have
artificially generated a population of BBH escapers from a GC with N

	Abstract = {{Using highly accurate N-body simulations, we explore the evolution of
multiple massive black holes (hereafter MBHs) in a primordial galaxy
that is composed of stars and MBHs. The evolution is pursed with a
fourth-order Hermite scheme, where not only three-body interaction of
MBHs but also dynamical friction by stars are incorporated. Initially,
10 MBHs with equal masses of 10$^{7}$ M $_{sun}$ are set in
a host galaxy with 10$^{11}$ M $_{sun}$. It is found that
4-6 MBHs merge successively within 1 Gyr, emitting gravitational wave
radiation. The key process for the successive merger of MBHs is the
dynamical friction by field stars, which enhances three-body
interactions of MBHs when they enter the central regions of the galaxy.
The heaviest MBH always composes a close binary at the galactic center,
which shrinks owing to the angular momentum transfer by the third MBH
and eventually merges. The angular momentum transfer by the third MBH is
due to the sling-shot mechanism. We find that the secular Kozai
mechanism does not work for a binary to merge if we include the
relativistic pericenter shift. The simulations show that a multiple MBH
system can produce a heavier MBH at the galactic center purely through
N-body process. This merger path can be of great significance for the
growth of MBHs in a primordial galaxy. The merger of multiple MBHs may
be a potential source of gravitational waves for the Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna and pulsar timing.

	Abstract = {{At the moment of deepest core collapse, a star cluster core contains
less than ten stars. This small number makes the traditional treatment
of hard binary formation, assuming a homogeneous background density,
suspect. In a previous paper, we have found that indeed the conventional
wisdom of binary formation, based on three-body encounters, is
incorrect. Here we refine that insight, by further dissecting the
subsequent steps leading to hard binary formation. For this purpose, we
add some analysis tools in order to make the study less subjective. We
find that the conventional treatment does remain valid for direct
three-body scattering, but fails for resonant three-body scattering.
Especially democratic resonance scattering, which forms an important
part of the analytical theory of three-body binary formation, takes too
much space and time to be approximated as being isolated, in the context
of a cluster core around core collapse. We conclude that, while
three-body encounters can be analytically approximated as isolated,
subsequent strong perturbations typically occur whenever those
encounters give rise to democratic resonances. We present analytical
estimates postdicting our numerical results. If we only had been a bit
more clever, we could have predicted this qualitative behaviour.

core collapse is that three-body interactions of single stars form many
soft binaries, most of which are quickly destroyed, but eventually one
of them survives. We report on direct N-body simulations to test these
ideas, for the first time. We find that the assumptions are incorrect in
the majority of the cases: (1) quite a few three-body interactions
produce a hard binary from scratch; (2) in many cases there are more
than three bodies directly and simultaneously involved in the production
of the first binary. The main reason for the discrepancies is that the
core of a star cluster, at the first deep collapse, contains typically
only five or so stars. Therefore, the homogeneous background assumption,
which still would be reasonable for, say, 25 stars, utterly breaks down.
There have been some speculations in this direction, but we demonstrate
this result here explicitly, for the first time.

	Abstract = {{We investigate the long-term dynamical evolution of star clusters in a
steady tidal field produced by its parent galaxy. In this paper, we
focus on the influence of the mass profile of the parent galaxy.
Previous studies were done with simplification, where the parent galaxy
was expressed by the point mass. We express different mass profiles of
the parent galaxy by the tidal fields in which the ratios of the
epicyclic frequency, {$\kappa$}, to the angular velocity, {$\omega$} are
different. We compare the mass-loss timescale of star clusters whose
tidal radii are identical, but in parent galaxies with different mass
profiles, by means of orbits calculations in fixed cluster potential and
N-body simulations. In this situation, a cluster rotates around the
parent galaxy more rapidly, since the parent galaxy has a shallower mass
profile. We found that the mass-loss timescale increase by 20\% and 50\%
for the cases that the mass-density profiles of the parent galaxies are
proportional to R$^{-2}$ and R$^{-1.5}$, where R is the
distance from the galaxy center, compared to the point-mass case, in a
moderately strong tidal field. Counterintuitively, a cluster that
rotates around the parent galaxy more rapidly has a longer lifetime. The
increase of the lifetime is due to the fact that the fraction occupied
by a regular-like orbit increases in a shallower profile. Finally, we
derive an evaluation formula for the mass-loss timescale of clusters.
Our formula can explain a property of the population of the observed
galactic globular clusters, that their half-mass radii become smaller as
their distances from the galactic center become smaller.

	Abstract = {{We show, using global three-dimensional grid-based hydrodynamical
simulations, that ultrafast outflows (UFOs) from active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) result in considerable feedback of energy and momentum into the
interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy. The AGN wind interacts
strongly with the inhomogeneous, two-phase ISM consisting of dense
clouds embedded in a tenuous, hot, hydrostatic medium. The outflow
floods through the intercloud channels, sweeps up the hot ISM, and
ablates and disperses the dense clouds. The momentum of the UFO is
primarily transferred to the dense clouds via the ram pressure in the
channel flow, and the wind-blown bubble evolves in the energy-driven
regime. Any dependence on UFO opening angle disappears after the first
interaction with obstructing clouds. On kpc scales, therefore, feedback
by UFOs operates similarly to feedback by relativistic AGN jets.
Negative feedback is significantly stronger if clouds are distributed
spherically rather than in a disk. In the latter case, the turbulent
backflow of the wind drives mass inflow toward the central black hole.
Considering the common occurrence of UFOs in AGNs, they are likely to be
important in the cosmological feedback cycles of galaxy formation.

high-velocity flow through the porous channels of the warm phase, flow

is additionally mass loaded by ablated cloud material. This mechanism
transfers 10\% to 40\% of the jet energy to the cold and warm gas,
accelerating it within a few 10 to 100 Myr to velocities that match
those observed in a range of high- and low-redshift radio galaxies

Ly{$\alpha$} haloes appears to be proportional to the square of the LAE
surface density (r Ly {$\alpha$}{\prop}{$\Sigma$} LAE 2). Including the
diffuse, extended Ly{$\alpha$} haloes, the rest-frame Ly{$\alpha$} equivalent
width of the LAEs in the densest regions approaches EW$_{0}$

gravitational gas inflows may partly contribute to the illumination of
Ly{$\alpha$} haloes; however, most of their Ly{$\alpha$} luminosity can be
explained by photoionization by or by scattering of Ly{$\alpha$} photons

Regardless of the source of Ly{$\alpha$} photons, if the Ly{$\alpha$} haloes
trace the overall gaseous structure, following the dark matter
distribution, it is not surprising that the Ly{$\alpha$} spatial extent

	Abstract = {{We propose a novel method of extracting the imprint of gravitational
lensing by Population III stars in the light curves of gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs). Significant portions of GRBs can originate in hypernovae of
Population III stars and be gravitationally lensed by foreground
Population III stars or their remnants. If the lens mass is on the order
of 10$^{2}$-10$^{3}$ M$_{solar}$ and the lens redshift
is greater than 10, the time delay between two lensed images of a GRB is
\~{}1 s and the image separation is \~{}10 {$\mu$}as. Although it is difficult to
resolve the two lensed images spatially with current facilities, the
light curves of the two images are superimposed with a delay of \~{}1 s.
GRB light curves usually exhibit noticeable variability, where each
spike is less than 1 s. If a GRB is lensed, all spikes are superimposed
with the same time delay. Hence, if the autocorrelation of the light
curve with changing time interval is calculated, it should show
resonance at the time delay of the lensed images. Applying this
autocorrelation method to GRB light curves that are archived as the
BATSE catalog, we demonstrate that more than half of the light curves
show recognizable resonance they are lensed. Furthermore, in 1821 GRBs
we actually find one candidate for a GRB lensed by a Population III
star, which may be located at redshift 20-200. The present method is
quite straightforward and therefore provides an effective tool for
searching for Population III stars at redshift greater than 10. Using
this method, we may find more candidates for GRBs lensed by Population
III stars in the data of the Swift satellite.

UV emissivity at 7{\lt}=z{\lt}=12 can make a noticeable contribution to
the early reionization. The maximal emissivity is higher than the level
required to keep ionizing the intergalactic matter (IGM) at
7{\lt}=z{\lt}=12. However, if the escape fraction of ionizing photons from
Pop. III objects is smaller than 10\%, then the IGM can be neutralized at
some redshift, which may lead to the double reionization. As for the
enrichment, the ejection of all metals synthesized in Pop. III objects
is marginally consistent with the IGM metallicity, although the
confinement of metals in Pop. III objects can reduce the enrichment
significantly.

Subaru Deep Field. This object is selected as a candidate of an
i$^{'}$-dropout high-redshift galaxy around z=6 because of its red
i$^{'}$-z$^{'}$ color in our deep optical imaging survey in
the Subaru Deep Field. Our follow-up optical spectroscopy reveals that
this object is a strong Ly{$\alpha$} emitter with only very faint
ultraviolet continuum. The rest-frame equivalent width of the detected
Ly{$\alpha$} emission is as much as 130 {\AA}. Thus the light detected in
our z$^{'}$ image is largely attributed to the Ly{$\alpha$} emission,
i.e., \~{}40\% of the z$^{'}$-band flux is the strong Ly{$\alpha$}
emission, giving a very red i$^{'}$-z$^{'}$ color. This is
consistent with the photometric property of this object because the
narrowband data obtained with the NB921 filter show a significant
depression, z$^{'}$-NB921=-0.54 mag. By using the photometric
data, we show that some other objects among the 48 i$^{'}$-dropout
high-redshift galaxy candidates found in the Subaru Deep Field also show
a significant NB921 depression. We briefly discuss the nature of these
NB921-depressed objects.

III objects exposed to the external ultraviolet background (UVB)
radiation. Assuming spherical symmetry, we solve self-consistently
radiative transfer of photons, non-equilibrium H$_{2}$ chemistry
and gas hydrodynamics. Although the UVB does suppress the formation of
low-mass objects, the negative feedback turns out to be weaker than
previously suggested. In particular, the cut-off scale of collapse drops
significantly below the virial temperature
T$_{vir}$\~{}10$^{4}$K at weak UV intensities
(J$_{21}${\lt}\~{}10$^{-2}$), owing to both self-shielding of
the gas and H$_{2}$ cooling. Clouds above this cut-off tend to
contract highly dynamically, further promoting self-shielding and
H$_{2}$ formation. For plausible radiation intensities and
spectra, the collapsing gas can cool efficiently to temperatures well
below 10$^{4}$K before rotationally supported and the final
H$_{2}$ fraction reaches \~{}10$^{-3}$.

Our results imply that star formation can take place in low-mass objects
collapsing in the UVB. The threshold baryon mass for star formation is
\~{}10$^{9}$M$_{solar}$ for clouds collapsing at redshifts
z{\lt}\~{}3, but drops significantly at higher redshifts. In a conventional
cold dark matter universe, the latter coincides roughly with that of the
1{$\sigma$} density fluctuations. Objects near and above this threshold can
thus constitute `building blocks' of luminous structures, and we discuss
their links to dwarf spheroidal/elliptical galaxies and faint blue
objects. These results suggest that the UVB can play a key role in
regulating the star formation history of the Universe.

this redshift range beyond our measurement uncertainties. Combining this
result and the previously known UV-continuum size evolution, we infer
that the ratio of LAH to UV-continuum sizes is nearly constant at z =

Ly{$\alpha$} emitters (LAEs) at z \~{} 2.2 that are observed with the Hubble
Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys and WFC3-IR during deep
extra-galactic legacy surveys. We confirm that the merger fraction and
the average ellipticity of LAE's stellar component are 10\%-30\% and
0.4-0.6, respectively, that are comparable with previous study results.
We successfully identify that some LAEs have a spatial offset between
Ly{$\alpha$} and stellar-continuum emission peaks,
{$\delta$}$_{Lyalpha}$, by \~{}2.5-4 kpc beyond our statistical
errors. To uncover the physical origin of strong Ly{$\alpha$} emission
found in LAEs, we investigate the Ly{$\alpha$} equivalent width (EW)
dependences of three structural parameters: merger fraction,
{$\delta$}$_{Lyalpha}$, and ellipticity of stellar distribution in
the range of EW(Ly{$\alpha$}) = 20-250 {\AA}. Contrary to expectations,
we find that the merger fraction does not significantly increase with
Ly{$\alpha$} EW. We reveal an anti-correlation between
{$\delta$}$_{Lyalpha}$ and EW(Ly{$\alpha$}) using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov
(K-S) test. There is a trend that the LAEs with a large Ly{$\alpha$} EW
have a small ellipticity. This is consistent with the recent theoretical
claims that Ly{$\alpha$} photons can more easily escape from face-on disks
having a small ellipticity, due to less inter-stellar gas along the line
of sight, although our K-S test indicates that this trend is not
statistically significant. Our results of Ly{$\alpha$}-EW dependence
generally support the idea that an H I column density is a key quantity
determining Ly{$\alpha$} emissivity.

	Abstract = {{Based on a three-dimensional model of an early star-forming galaxy, we
explore the evolution of the sub-millimetre brightness. The model galaxy
is employed from an ultra-high-resolution chemodynamic simulation of a
primordial galaxy by Mori {\amp} Umemura, where the star formation rate
(SFR) is {\tilde}10 M$_{&sun;}$ yr$^{-1}$ at
t$_{age}${\lsim} 0.3 Gyr and several M$_{&sun;}$
yr$^{-1}$ at t$_{age}$ {\gt}0.3 Gyr. The former phase well
reproduces the observed properties of Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) and
the latter does Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). We solve the
three-dimensional radiative transfer in the clumpy interstellar media in
this model galaxy, taking the size distributions of dust grains into
account, and calculate the dust temperature as a function of galactic
evolutionary time. We find that the clumpiness of interstellar media
plays an important role for the sub-millimetre brightness. In the LAE
phase, dust grains are concentrated on clumpy star-forming regions that
are distributed all over the galaxy, and the grains can effectively
absorb ultraviolet (UV) radiation from stars. As a result, the dust is
heated up to T$_{dust}${\gsim}35 K. In the LBG phase, the
continuous supernovae drive dust grains far away from star-forming
regions. Then, the grains cannot absorb much radiation from stars, and
become a cold state close to the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
temperature. Consequently, the dust temperature decreases with the
evolutionary time, where the mass-weighted mean temperature is
T$_{dust}$= 26 K at t$_{age}$= 0.1 Gyr and T$_{dust}$=
21 K at t$_{age}$= 1.0 Gyr. By this analysis, it turns out that
the sub-millimetre brightness is higher in the LAE phase than that in
the LBG phase, although the dust-to-gas ratio increases monotonically as
a function of time. We derive the spectral energy distributions by
placing the model galaxy at a given redshift. The peak flux at 850 {$\mu$}
m is found to be S$_{850}${\tilde} 0.2-0.9 mJy if the model galaxy
is placed at 6 {\ge}z{\ge} 2. This means that Atacama Large
Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA) can detect an early star-forming
galaxy with SFR of {\tilde}10 M$_{&sun;}$ yr$^{-1}$ by less
than one hour integration with 16 antennas.

@article{2010MNRAS.406..913S,
	Abstract = {{In the last decade, numerous Lyman {$\alpha$} (Ly{$\alpha$}) emitters (LAEs)
have been discovered with narrow-band filters at various redshifts.
Recently, multiwavelength observations of LAEs have been performed and
revealed that while many LAEs appear to be young and less massive, a
noticeable fraction of LAEs possess much older populations of stars and
larger stellar mass. How these two classes of LAEs are concordant with
the hierarchical galaxy formation scenario has not been understood
clearly so far. In this paper, we model LAEs by three-dimensional
cosmological simulations of dark halo merger in a {$\Lambda$} cold dark
matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) universe. As a result, it is shown that the age of
simulated LAEs can spread over a wide range from 2 {\times}
10$^{6}$ to 9 {\times} 10$^{8}$yr. Furthermore, we find that
there are two types of LAEs, in one of which the young half-mass age is
comparable to the mean age of stellar component, and in the other of
which the young half-mass age is appreciably shorter than the mean age.
We define the former as Type 1 LAEs and the latter as Type 2 LAEs. A
Type 1 LAE corresponds to early starburst in a young galaxy, whereas a
Type 2 LAE does to delayed starburst in an evolved galaxy, as a
consequence of delayed accretion of a subhalo on to a larger parent
halo. Thus, the same halo can experience a Type 2 LAE phase as well as a
Type 1 LAE phase in the merger history. Type 1 LAEs are expected to be
younger than 1.5 {\times} 10$^{8}$yr, less dusty and less massive
with stellar mass M$_{star}$ {\lt}\~{} 5 {\times}
10$^{8}$M$_{solar}$, while Type 2 LAEs are older than 1.5
{\times} 10$^{8}$yr, even dustier and as massive as
M$_{star}$ \~{} 5 {\times} 10$^{8}$-3 {\times}
10$^{10}$M$_{solar}$. The fraction of Type 2s in all LAEs is
a function of redshift, which is less than 2 per cent at z {\gt}\~{} 4.5,
\~{}30 per cent at redshift z = 3.1 and \~{}70 per cent at z = 2. Type 2 LAEs
can be discriminated clearly from Type 1s in two-colour diagrams of z' -
H versus J - K. We find that the brightness distribution of Ly{$\alpha$} in
Type 2 LAEs is more extended than the main stellar component, in
contrast to Type 1 LAEs. This is not only because delayed starbursts
tend to occur in the outskirts of a parent galaxy, but also because
Ly{$\alpha$} photons are effectively absorbed by dust in an evolved galaxy.
Hence, the extent of Ly{$\alpha$} emission may be an additional measure to
distinguish Type 2 LAEs from Type 1 LAEs. The sizes of Type 2 LAEs range
from a few tens to a few hundreds kpc. At lower redshifts, the number of
more extended, older Type 2 LAEs increases. Furthermore, it is
anticipated that the amplitude of angular correlation function for Type
2 LAEs is significantly higher than that for Type 1 LAEs, but comparable
to that for Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). This implies that LBGs with
strong Ly{$\alpha$} line may include Type 2 LAEs.

	Abstract = {{The development of radiation hydrodynamical methods that are able to
follow gas dynamics and radiative transfer (RT) self-consistently is key
to the solution of many problems in numerical astrophysics. Such fluid
flows are highly complex, rarely allowing even for approximate
analytical solutions against which numerical codes can be tested. An
alternative validation procedure is to compare different methods against
each other on common problems, in order to assess the robustness of the
results and establish a range of validity for the methods. Previously,
we presented such a comparison for a set of pure RT tests (i.e. for
fixed, non-evolving density fields). This is the second paper of the
Cosmological Radiative Transfer Comparison Project, in which we compare
nine independent RT codes directly coupled to gas dynamics on three
relatively simple astrophysical hydrodynamics problems: (i) the
expansion of an HII region in a uniform medium, (ii) an ionization front
in a 1/r$^{2}$ density profile with a flat core and (iii) the
photoevaporation of a uniform dense clump. Results show a broad
agreement between the different methods and no big failures, indicating
that the participating codes have reached a certain level of maturity
and reliability. However, many details still do differ, and virtually
every code has showed some shortcomings and has disagreed, in one
respect or another, with the majority of the results. This underscores
the fact that no method is universal and all require careful testing of
the particular features which are most relevant to the specific problem
at hand.

reproduces the observed properties of LAEs and LBGs. The total mass of

photoionization but also collisional ionization by shocks. In addition,
according to the chemical enrichment, we incorporate the effect of dust
extinction, taking the size distributions of dust into account. As a
result, we find that dust extinction reduces the escape fractions by a
factor of 1.5-8.5 in the LAE phase and by a factor of 2.5-11 in the LBG
phase, while the collisional ionization by shocks increases the escape
fractions by a factor of \~{}2. The resultant escape fractions are
0.07-0.47 in the LAE phase and 0.06-0.17 in the LBG phase. These results
are well concordant with the recent estimations derived from the flux
density ratio at 1500 to 900 {\AA} of LAEs and LBGs. Combining the
resultant escape fractions with the luminosity functions of LAEs and
LBGs, we find that high-z LAEs and LBGs can ionize the IGM at z = 3-5.
However, ionizing radiation from LAEs as well as LBGs falls short of
ionizing the IGM at z {\gt} 6. That implies that additional ionization
sources may be required at z {\gt} 6.

	Abstract = {{We consider the effect of a supernova (SN) explosion in a very massive
binary that is expected to form in a portion of Population III stars
with the mass higher than 100M$_{solar}$. In a Population III
binary system, a more massive star can result in the formation of a
black hole (BH) and a surrounding accretion disc. Such BH accretion
could be a significant source of the cosmic reionization in the early
Universe. However, a less massive companion star evolves belatedly and
eventually undergoes a SN explosion, so that the accretion disc around a
BH might be blown off in a lifetime of companion star. In this paper, we
explore the dynamical impact of a SN explosion on an accretion disc
around a massive BH, and elucidate whether the BH accretion disc is
totally demolished or not. For the purpose, we perform three-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations of a very massive binary system, where we
assume a BH of 10$^{3}$M$_{solar}$ that results from a
direct collapse of a very massive star and a companion star of
100M$_{solar}$ that undergoes a SN explosion. We calculate the
remaining mass of a BH accretion disc as a function of time. As a
result, it is found that a significant portion of gas disc can survive
through three-dimensional geometrical effects even after the SN
explosion of a companion star. Even if the SN explosion energy is higher
by two orders of magnitude than the binding energy of gas disc, about a
half of disc can be left over. The results imply that the Population III
BH accretion disc can be a long-lived luminous source, and therefore
could be an important ionizing source in the early Universe.

distributions appear to be incompatible with the standard biased galaxy

two kinds of two-color diagram: V-i' versus i'-z' and R-i' versus i'-z'.
The adopted selection criteria are proved to be fairly reliable by
spectroscopic observations. We derive the luminosity functions of the
LBGs at rest-frame ultraviolet wavelengths down to M$_{UV}$=-19.2
at z\~{}4 and M$_{UV}$=-20.3 at z\~{}5. We find clear evolution of the
luminosity function over the redshift range 0{\lt}=z{\lt}=6, which is
accounted for solely by a change in the characteristic magnitude
M$^{*}$. We examine the evolution of the cosmic star formation
rate (SFR) density and its luminosity dependence over 0{\lt}=z{\lt}\~{}6. The
SFR density contributed from brighter galaxies is found to change more
drastically with cosmic time. The contribution from brighter galaxies
has a sharp peak around z=3-4, while that from fainter galaxies evolves
relatively mildly with a broad peak at earlier epochs. Combining the
observed SFR density with the standard cold dark matter model, we
compute the cosmic SFR per unit baryon mass in dark halos, that is, the
specific SFR. The specific SFR is found to scale with redshift as
(1+z)$^{3}$ up to z\~{}4, implying that the efficiency of star
formation is on average higher at higher redshift in proportion to the
cooling rate within dark halos, while this is not simply the case at
z{\gt}\~{}4.

	Abstract = {{Radiative transfer (RT) simulations are now at the forefront of
numerical astrophysics. They are becoming crucial for an increasing
number of astrophysical and cosmological problems; at the same time
their computational cost has come within reach of currently available
computational power. Further progress is retarded by the considerable
number of different algorithms (including various flavours of ray
tracing and moment schemes) developed, which makes the selection of the
most suitable technique for a given problem a non-trivial task.
Assessing the validity ranges, accuracy and performances of these
schemes is the main aim of this paper, for which we have compared 11
independent RT codes on five test problems: (0) basic physics; (1)
isothermal HII region expansion; (2) HII region expansion with evolving
temperature; (3) I-front trapping and shadowing by a dense clump and (4)
multiple sources in a cosmological density field. The outputs of these
tests have been compared and differences analysed. The agreement between
the various codes is satisfactory although not perfect. The main source
of discrepancy appears to reside in the multifrequency treatment
approach, resulting in different thicknesses of the ionized-neutral
transition regions and the temperature structure. The present results
and tests represent the most complete benchmark available for the
development of new codes and improvement of existing ones. To further
this aim all test inputs and outputs are made publicly available in
digital form.

identified eight more LAEs, giving a total of 17 spectroscopically
confirmed LAEs at z=6.5. Based on this spectroscopic sample of 17,
complemented by a photometric sample of 58 LAEs, we have derived a more
accurate Ly{$\alpha$} luminosity function of LAEs at z=6.5, which reveals
an apparent deficit at the bright end of \~{}0.75 mag fainter

the LAE luminosity functions between z=5.7 and 6.5 is significant at the
3 {$\sigma$} level, which is reduced to 2 {$\sigma$} when cosmic variance is
taken into account. This result may imply that the reionization of the
universe has not been completed at z=6.5. We found that the spatial
distribution of LAEs at z=6.5 was homogeneous over the field. We discuss
the implications of these results for the reionization of the universe.

M-type ionization front with a shock propagates, and density peaks are
radiation-hydrodynamically evaporated by the shock. The threshold
density depends on the distance from the source star and is
\~{}10$^{2}$ cm$^{-3}$ for a source distance of 30 pc. Taking
into consideration that the extent of a Population III object is \~{}100 pc

requires a proper treatment of these processes, but hitherto this has

	Abstract = {{We explored the clustering properties of Lyman break galaxies at z=4 and
5 with an angular two-point correlation function on the basis of the
very deep and wide Subaru Deep Field data. We confirmed the previous
result that the clustering strength of LBGs depends on the UV luminosity
in the sense that brighter LBGs are more strongly clustered. In
addition, we found an apparent dependence of the correlation function
slope on UV luminosity for LBGs at both z=4 and 5. More luminous LBGs
have a steeper correlation function. The bias parameter was found to be
a scale-dependent function for bright LBGs, whereas it appears to be
almost scale-independent for faint LBGs. Luminous LBGs have a higher
bias at smaller angular scales, which decreases as the scale increases.
To compare these observational results, we constructed numerical mock
LBG catalogs based on a semianalytic model of hierarchical clustering
combined with high-resolution N-body simulation, carefully mimicking the
observational selection effects. The luminosity functions and the
overall correlation functions for LBGs at z=4 and 5 predicted by this
mock catalog were found to be almost consistent with the observation.
The observed dependence of the clustering on UV luminosity was not
reproduced by the model, unless subsamples of distinct halo mass were
considered. That is, LBGs belonging to more massive dark halos had
steeper and larger amplitude correlation functions. With this model, we
found that LBG multiplicity in massive dark halos amplifies the
clustering strength at small scales, which steepens the correlation
function. The hierarchical clustering model could therefore be
reconciled with the observed luminosity dependence of the correlation
function if there is a tight correlation between UV luminosity and halo
mass. Our finding that the slope of the correlation function depends on
luminosity could be an indication that massive dark halos hosted
multiple bright LBGs.

by dusty gas clouds that spurt out from circumnuclear starburst regions.
For this purpose, the dynamical evolution of gas clouds is pursued,
including the effects of radiation forces by an AGN as well as a
starburst. Here we solve the radiative transfer equations for clouds,
taking into consideration the growth of clouds by inelastic cloud-cloud
collisions and the resultant change in optical depth. As a result, if
the starburst is more luminous than the AGN, gas clouds are distributed
extensively above the galactic disk with the assistance of radiation
pressure from the starburst. The total covering factor of gas clouds
reaches a maximum of about 20\%. After several 10$^{7}$ yr, gas
clouds with larger optical depth form by cloud-cloud collisions;
thereafter the clouds fall back as a result of weakened radiation
pressure. The larger clouds undergo runaway growth and are eventually
distributed around the equatorial plane on the inner sides of
circumnuclear starburst regions. These clouds have an optical depth of
several tens. The result is qualitatively consistent with the putative
tendency that Seyfert 2 galaxies appear more frequently associated with
starbursts than Seyfert 1 galaxies. On the other hand, if the AGN
luminosity overwhelms that of the starburst, almost all clouds are
ejected from the galaxy as a result of the radiation pressure from the
AGN, resulting in the formation of a quasar-like object. The origin of
obscuration of AGNs is discussed with relevant observations.

The collapse of a rotating cylinder is simulated with a
three-dimensional, high-resolution nested grid, assuming the thermal
history of primordial gas. The simulations are done with dimensionless
units, and the results are applicable to low-mass as well as massive
systems by scaling with the initial density. We find that if the initial
angular momentum is as small as {$\beta$}\~{}0.1, where {$\beta$} is the ratio of
centrifugal force to pressure force and is of the order of 10\%, then the
runaway collapse of the cloud stops to form a rotationally supported
disk. After the accretion of the envelope, the disk undergoes a ring
instability, eventually fragmenting into a binary. If the initial
angular momentum is relatively large, a bar-type instability arises,
resulting in the collapse into a single star through rapid angular
momentum transfer. The present results show that a significant fraction
of Population III stars are expected to form in binary systems, even if
they are quite massive or less massive. The cosmological implications of
Population III binaries are briefly discussed.

radiation drag from interstellar clouds moving in uniform radiation
fields. To include relativistic radiation drag properly, the radiation
hydrodynamic equation is solved taking into account the dilution of
radiation fields by the optical depth of the cloud. As a result, it is
found that the optically thin surface layers are effectively stripped by
radiation drag from an optically thick gas cloud, and, simultaneously,
the stripped gas loses momentum. The momentum loss time-scale is found
to be on the order of 10$^{8}$ yr under the intensive radiation
fields expected in the early phase of galaxy evolution. The present
results show that the radiation drag is an effective mechanism for
extracting angular momentum from the interstellar medium and allows it
to accrete on to the galactic centre. Mass accretion driven by radiation
drag may lead to the formation of a central supermassive black hole.

using 1024$^{3}$ grid points, where SN remnants are resolved with
sufficient accuracy. It is found that multiple SN explosions produce
kiloparsec-size expanding hot bubbles, which drive cool, dense shells by
strong shock. The colliding high-density cooling shells radiate
intensive Ly{$\alpha$} emission, resulting in a high Ly{$\alpha$} luminosity

are quite similar to the structure predicted in the present simulation.
Furthermore, the result demonstrates that LABs are representative of
evolving primordial galaxies; they could hold direct information on the
early chemical enrichment of galaxies, contrary to present-day galaxies
that have undergone intense recycling of interstellar matter, thus
erasing most of the early chemical history. It turns out that the metal
mixing proceeds in a very inhomogeneous fashion, so that there appears a
large spread of metallicity, that is, [Fe/H]\~{}0 to-5 or [O/H]\~{}1 to-4.
Hence, the early galactic chemical evolution may have proceeded in a

hydrodynamics code that self-consistently incorporates radiative
transfer and nonequilibrium primordial gas chemistry. The star-forming
region is defined as a spherical dense molecular gas cloud with a
Population III star embedded at the center. We explore a large parameter
space by considering, as plausible early star-forming sites, dark matter
halos of mass M$_{halo}$=10$^{5}$-10$^{8}$
M$_{solar}$, gas density profiles with a power-law index
w=1.5-2.25, and metal-free stars of mass M$_{star}$=25-500
M$_{solar}$. The formation of the H II region is characterized by
initial slow expansion of a weak D-type ionization front near the
center, followed by rapid propagation of an R-type front throughout the
outer gas envelope. We find that the transition between the two front
types is indeed a critical condition for the complete ionization of
halos of cosmological interest. In small-mass ({\lt}\~{}10$^{6}$
M$_{solar}$) halos, the transition takes place within a few
10$^{5}$ yr, yielding high escape fractions ({\gt}80\%) of both
ionizing and photodissociating photons. The gas is effectively evacuated
by a supersonic shock, with the mean density within the halo decreasing
to {\lt}\~{}1 cm$^{-3}$ in a few million years. In larger mass
({\gt}\~{}10$^{7}$ M$_{solar}$) halos, the ionization front
remains to be of D-type over the lifetime of the massive star, the H II
region is confined well inside the virial radius, and the escape
fractions are essentially zero. We derive an analytic formula that
reproduces well the results of our simulations for the critical halo
mass below which the gas is completely ionized. We discuss immediate
implications of the present results for the star formation history and
early reionization of the universe.

pointed out that the cold dark matter cosmology suffers from a
substructure problem in which more subgalactic halos are produced in the
Local Group than dwarf galaxies. In this Letter, as a potential
mechanism for solving this problem, we consider the feedback effects of
early reionization on the formation of small-scale structures. For this

As a result, it is found that the early reionization is devastating for
low-mass systems with M$_{vir}${\lt}\~{}10$^{8}$

almost all gas is photoevaporated in more than 95\% of low-mass systems.
Such a strong negative feedback on the formation of low-mass galaxies

chemistry of primordial gas including H$_{2}$ molecules is also
incorporated. Attention is concentrated on radiative transfer effects on
the UVB for the formation of subgalactic objects with
T$_{vir}${\lt}\~{}10$^{4}$ K. We consider a reionization model
with z$_{reion}$\~{}7 and also the earlier reionization model
(z$_{reion}$\~{}17) inferred by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
Probe (WMAP). We find that star formation is suppressed appreciably by
UVB, but baryons at high-density peaks are self-shielded even during the
reionization, forming some amount of stars eventually. In that sense,
the photoevaporation for subgalactic systems is not as perfect as argued
by one-dimensional spherical calculations. The final stellar fraction
depends on the collapse epoch and the mass of the system, almost
regardless of the reionization epoch. For instance, a few tenths of the
formed stars are born after the cosmic reionization in the
z$_{reion}$\~{}7 model, while more than 90\% of the stars are born
after the reionization in the WMAP reionization model. Thus, the effects
of UVB feedback on the substructure problem with a cold dark matter

radiative transfer. The star clusters formed at high-density peaks
coalesce with each other in a dissipationless fashion in a dark matter
potential, as a resultant forming a spheroidal system. As a result,
these low-mass galaxies have large mass-to-light ratios, such as
observed in dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Local Group.

N-body simulations based on the CDM scenario for structure formation is
much larger than the observed substructures. Therefore, it is crucial
for this crisis to discriminate whether the expected number of CDM
substructures really exist without detectable radiation, or do not
exist. In this paper, we present a new idea to detect such invisible
substructures by utilizing gravitational lensing. Here, we consider
quasars that are gravitationally lensed by a foreground galaxy. A
substructure around a lensing galaxy may superposed on one of the lensed
images of such quasars. In this situation, additional image splitting
should occur in the image behind the substructure, and additional
multiple images are created. From our estimations, the separation and
time delay between the additional multiple images are expected to be
1-30 milli-arcsecond and 1-10$^{3}$ second, respectively.
Furthermore, we evaluate that the optical depth for such events is sim
0.1. Consequently, future fine-resolution imaging and/or high-speed

peak flux is insensitive to i. Based on this result, we introduce a
novel indicator f$_{L}$, which is the ratio of L$_{SED}$ to

f$_{L}$, we can determine the inclination regardless of the other
physical parameters. The inclination would be determined by
f$_{L}$ within an accuracy of +/-5{\deg} if the opening angle of
bipolar outflows is specified by any other procedure. Since this

hole accretion flows by solving radiation transfer as well as the energy

generally overestimates the luminosity of the disk around the Eddington

effective temperature profile since it neglects time delay between
energy generation deeper inside the disk and energy release at the
surface. The photon-trapping effects are especially appreciable even
below L\~{}L$_{E}$, while they appear above \~{}3L$_{E}$ according
to the slim disk. Through the photon-trapping effects, the luminosity is
reduced and the effective temperature profile becomes flatter than
r$^{-3/4}$, as in the standard disk. In the case in which the
viscous heating is effective only around the equatorial plane, the
luminosity is kept around the Eddington luminosity even at a very large
mass accretion rate, M{\gt}{\gt}L$_{E}$/c$^{2}$. The effective
temperature profile is almost flat, and the maximum temperature
decreases in accordance with a rise in the mass accretion rate. Thus,
the most luminous radius shifts to the outer region when
M/(L$_{E}$/c$^{2}$){\gt}{\gt}10$^{2}$. In the case in
which the energy is dissipated equally at any height, the resultant
luminosity is somewhat larger than in the former case, but the energy
conversion still efficiently decreases with an increase of the mass
accretion rate as well. The most luminous radius stays around the inner
edge of the disk in the latter case. Hence, the effective temperature

cooling overwhelms H$_{2}$ cooling. The contraction of a filament

decelerated when the central density (n$_{c}$) reaches a critical
density of HD at which LTE level populations are achieved, and therefore
the filament is expected to fragment at \~{}10$^{7}$ cm$^{-3}$.
The fragment mass is lowered to be \~{}10 M$_{solar}$. In contrast,
the contraction of a filament with n$_{c,0}${\lt}\~{}10$^{5}$
cm$^{-3}$ and
x$_{H<SUB>2}$,0</SUB>{\lt}\~{}x$_{H<SUB>2}$,cr</SUB> is
regulated by H$_{2}$ cooling. In this case, the filament tends to
fragment at lower density as \~{}10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$ owing to
the low critical density of H$_{2}$, and the fragment mass is as
high as \~{}10$^{2}$ M$_{solar}$. For a high-density filament
with n$_{c,0}${\gt}\~{}10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$, the temperature
stays at a relatively high value because both H$_{2}$ and HD
cooling saturate, and the cloud evolution is governed by H$_{2}$
cooling. The contraction of a high-density filament is accelerated by
effective three-body H$_{2}$ formation when the density reaches
10$^{8}$-10$^{9}$ cm$^{-3}$. Fragmentation is not
expected to take place until the cloud becomes opaque in H$_{2}$
lines at n$_{c,0}$\~{}10$^{12}$-10$^{13}$
cm$^{-3}$, so that the fragment mass is reduced to 1-2
M$_{solar}$. As a result, the stellar initial mass function could
be bimodal and deficient in sub-solar mass stars, where the high-mass
peak is around 10 or 10$^{2}$ M$_{solar}$, dependent on
n$_{c,0}$ and x$_{H<SUB>2}$,0</SUB>. If the protogalactic
clouds are ionized by UV radiation or strong shocks, the H$_{2}$

starburst around an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We concentrate our
attention on the role of the radiation force of a starburst as well as
an AGN, in which the effects of the optical depth of dusty gas are taken
into consideration. First, we solve the hydrostatic equations in
spherical symmetry coupled with the frequency-dependent radiative
processes to demonstrate that a geometrically thin, optically thick wall
forms because of the radiation pressure of a circumnuclear starburst.
Next, in two-dimensional axisymmetric space, we analyze the
configuration and the stability of geometrically thin walls that are
balanced between radiation pressure and gravity. As a result, it is
shown that the radiation force of the circumnuclear starburst works to
stabilize optically thick walls surrounding the nucleus. In the case of
a brighter starburst with a fainter AGN (e.g.,
L$_{SB}$/M$_{SB}${\gt}\~{}10
[L$_{solar}$/M$_{solar}$] and
L$_{AGN}${\lt}\~{}10$^{11}$ L$_{solar}$), there form
double walls, the inner one of which is located between the nucleus and
the circumnuclear starburst and the outer one of which enshrouds both
the starburst regions and the nucleus. The total extinction of both
walls turns out to be larger for a brighter starburst, which is
A$_{V}$\~{}10 mag for
L$_{SB}$/M$_{SB}${\gt}\~{}10$^{2}$
(L$_{solar}$/M$_{solar}$). As a consequence, double walls
could heavily obscure the nucleus to make this a type 2 AGN. The outer
wall may provide an explanation for the recent indications for
large-scale obscuring materials in Seyfert 2 galaxies. Also, it is
predicted that the AGN type is time-dependent according to the stellar
evolution in the starburst, which shifts from type 2 to type 1 in
several times 10$^{7}$ yr owing to the disappearance of walls. In
contrast, if the AGN itself is much brighter than the starburst, as a
quasar is, then neither wall forms regardless of the starburst activity,
and the nucleus is likely to be identified as type 1. To conclude, the
radiatively supported gas walls could be responsible for the putative
correlation between AGN type and the starbursts, whereby Seyfert 2
galaxies are more frequently associated with circumnuclear starbursts
than type 1 galaxies, whereas quasars are mostly observed as type 1 AGNs
regardless of the star-forming activity in the host galaxies.

explored using one- and two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations
coupled with the nonequilibrium processes of hydrogen molecule
formation. The cloud evolution is computed from the initial central
density n$_{c}$=10-10$^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$. The simulations
show that depending on the initial density, there are two occasions for
the fragmentation of primordial filaments. If a filament has relatively
low initial density such as n$_{c}${\lt}\~{}10$^{5}$
cm$^{-3}$, the radial contraction is slow as a result of less
effective H$_{2}$ cooling and appreciably decelerates at densities
higher than a critical density, where LTE populations are achieved for
the rotational levels of H$_{2}$ molecules and the cooling
timescale becomes accordingly longer than the free-fall timescale. This
filament tends to fragment into dense clumps before the central density
reaches 10$^{8}$-10$^{9}$ cm$^{-3}$, where
H$_{2}$ cooling by three-body reactions is effective and the
fragment mass is more massive than some tens of M$_{solar}$. In
contrast, if a filament is initially as dense as
n$_{c}${\gt}\~{}10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$, the more effective
H$_{2}$ cooling with the help of three-body reactions allows the
filament to contract up to n\~{}10$^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$. After the
density reaches n\~{}10$^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$, the filament becomes
optically thick to H$_{2}$ lines and the radial contraction
subsequently almost stops. At this final hydrostatic stage, the fragment
mass is lowered down to \~{}1 M$_{solar}$ because of the high density
of the filament. The dependence of the fragment mass upon the initial
density could be translated into the dependence on the local amplitude
of random Gaussian density fields or the epoch of the collapse of a
parent cloud. Hence, it is predicted that the initial mass function of
Population III stars is likely to be bimodal with peaks of
\~{}10$^{2}$ and \~{}1 M$_{solar}$, where the relative heights
could be a function of the collapse epoch. Implications for the metal
enrichment by Population III stars at high redshifts and baryonic dark

efficiency regime and are relatively insensitive to shock parameters.
This low CR acceleration efficiency branch of solutions may provide a
natural explanation for the line broadening of the H{$\alpha$} narrow
component observed in nonradiative shocks in many SNRs.

additional X-ray spectral components beyond a simple, single-temperature

effect emission maps at 600 GHz assuming the X-ray spectra are composed
of thermal gas with a steep power-law index component and also thermal
gas with a significant contribution of strongly heated gas. A
two-temperature model with a hot (kT {\sime} 30-40 keV) second component
is the most consistent with existing SZ data at high frequencies.
However, significant morphological differences remain.

	Abstract = {{ORIGIN is a proposal for the M3 mission call of ESA aimed at the study
of metal creation from the epoch of cosmic dawn. Using high-spectral
resolution in the soft X-ray band, ORIGIN will be able to identify the
physical conditions of all abundant elements between C and Ni to
red-shifts of z = 10, and beyond. The mission will answer questions such
as: When were the first metals created? How does the cosmic metal
content evolve? Where do most of the metals reside in the Universe? What
is the role of metals in structure formation and evolution? To reach out
to the early Universe ORIGIN will use Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) to study
their local environments in their host galaxies. This requires the
capability to slew the satellite in less than a minute to the GRB
location. By studying the chemical composition and properties of
clusters of galaxies we can extend the range of exploration to lower
redshifts ( z {\tilde}0.2). For this task we need a high-resolution
spectral imaging instrument with a large field of view. Using the same
instrument, we can also study the so far only partially detected baryons
in the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM). The less dense part of the
WHIM will be studied using absorption lines at low redshift in the
spectra for GRBs. The ORIGIN mission includes a Transient Event Detector
(coded mask with a sensitivity of 0.4 photon/cm$^{2}$/s in 10 s in
the 5-150 keV band) to identify and localize 2000 GRBs over a five year
mission, of which {\tilde}65 GRBs have a redshift {\gt}7. The Cryogenic
Imaging Spectrometer, with a spectral resolution of 2.5 eV, a field of
view of 30 arcmin and large effective area below 1 keV has the
sensitivity to study clusters up to a significant fraction of the virial
radius and to map the denser parts of the WHIM (factor 30 higher than
achievable with current instruments). The payload is complemented by a
Burst InfraRed Telescope to enable onboard red-shift determination of
GRBs (hence securing proper follow up of high-z bursts) and also probes
the mildly ionized state of the gas. Fast repointing is achieved by a
dedicated Controlled Momentum Gyro and a low background is achieved by
the selected low Earth orbit.

Our calculations of the SZ effect include relativistic corrections
considered within the framework of the Wright formalism and use a

multi-frequency measurements of the SZ effect, we find the solution of a
linear system of equations that is used to derive the Fourier

uncertainties in Fourier coefficient estimations. <BR /> Results: We
propose a method to derive DFs of electrons using SZ multi-frequency
observations of massive galaxy clusters. We found that the best

cosmology. EDGE (Piro et al., 2007) will trace the cosmic history of the
baryons from the early generations of massive stars by Gamma-Ray Burst
(GRB) explosions, through the period of galaxy cluster formation, down
to the very low redshift Universe, when between a third and one half of
the baryons are expected to reside in cosmic filaments undergoing
gravitational collapse by dark matter (the so-called warm hot
intragalactic medium). In addition EDGE, with its unprecedented
capabilities, will provide key results in many important fields. These
scientific goals are feasible with a medium class mission using existing
technology combined with innovative instrumental and observational
capabilities by: (a) observing with fast reaction Gamma-Ray Bursts with
a high spectral resolution. This enables the study of their star-forming
and host galaxy environments and the use of GRBs as back lights of large
scale cosmological structures; (b) observing and surveying extended
sources (galaxy clusters, WHIM) with high sensitivity using two wide
field of view X-ray telescopes (one with a high angular resolution and
the other with a high spectral resolution). The mission concept includes
four main instruments: a Wide-field Spectrometer (0.1-2.2 eV) with
excellent energy resolution (3 eV at 0.6 keV), a Wide-Field Imager
(0.3-6 keV) with high angular resolution (HPD = 15{\rdquo}) constant over
the full 1.4 degree field of view, and a Wide Field Monitor (8-200 keV)
with a FOV of {\frac14} of the sky, which will trigger the fast
repointing to the GRB. Extension of its energy response up to 1 MeV will
be achieved with a GRB detector with no imaging capability. This mission
is proposed to ESA as part of the Cosmic Vision call. We will outline
the science drivers and describe in more detail the payload of this

	Abstract = {{Context: We present the results of our analysis of long Suzaku
observations (149 ks and 122 ks for XIS and HXD, respectively) of the
most X-ray luminous galaxy cluster, RX J1347.5-1145, at z=0.451.  <BR
/>Aims: To understand the gas physics of a violent, cluster merger, we
study physical properties of the hot ( 20 keV) gas clump in the
south-east (SE) region discovered previously by Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ)
effect observations. Using hard X-ray data, a signature of non-thermal
emission is also explored.  <BR />Methods: We perform single as well as
multi-temperature fits to the Suzaku XIS spectra. The Suzaku XIS and
HXD, and the Chandra ACIS-I data are then combined to examine the
properties of the hot gas component in the SE region. We finally look
for non-thermal emission in the Suzaku HXD data.  <BR />Results: The
single-temperature model fails to reproduce the 0.5-10 keV continuum
emission and Fe-K lines measured by XIS simultaneously. A
two-temperature model with a very hot component improves the fit,
although the XIS data can only provide a lower limit to the temperature
of the hot component. In the Suzaku HXD data, we detect hard X-ray
emission above the background in the 12-40 keV band at the 9{$\sigma$}
level; however, the significance becomes marginal when the systematic
error in the background estimation is included. With the joint analysis
of the Suzaku and Chandra data, we determine the temperature of the hot
gas in the SE region to be 25.3$^{+6.1}$$_{-4.5}$
(statistical; 90\% confidence level) $^{+6.9}$$_{-9.5}$
(systematic; 90\% confidence level) keV, which is in an excellent
agreement with the previous joint analysis of the SZ effect in radio and
the Chandra X-ray data. This is the first time that the X-ray analysis
alone provides a good measurement of the hot component temperature in
the SE region, which is possible because of Suzaku's unprecedented
sensitivity over the wide X-ray band. These results indicate strongly
that RX J1347.5-1145 has undergone a recent, violent merger. The
spectral analysis shows that the SE component is consistent with being
thermal. We measure the 3{$\sigma$} upper limit to the non-thermal flux,
F{\lt}8{\times}10$^{-12}$ erg s$^{-1 cm^{-2}$$\}$ in the 12-60
keV band, which provides a limit on the inverse Compton scattering of
relativistic electrons off the CMB photons. Combining this limit with
the discovery of a radio mini halo in this cluster at 1.4 GHz, which
measures the synchrotron radiation, we find a lower limit to the
strength of the intracluster magnetic field, such that B{\gt}0.007 $\{${$\mu$}

(2) DC resistivity sounding, (3) seismic refraction, (4) very low
frequency (VHF) electromagnetic, (5) helicopter borne electromagnetic
(HEM), and (6) transient electromagnetic (TEM) techniques, were employed
to obtain information on the ice body properties of pingos near
Fairbanks, Alaska. The surface nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data
were also compared from similar sites near one of the study pingos. The
geophysical investigations were undertaken, along with core sampling and
permafrost drilling, to enable measurement of the ground temperature
regime. Drilling (ground truthing) results support field geophysical
investigations, and have led to the development of a technique for
distinguishing massive ice and overburden material of the permafrost.
The two-dimensional DC resistivity sounding tomography and
ground-penetrating radar profiling are useful for ice detection under
heterogeneous conditions. However, the DC resistivity sounding
investigation required high-quality ground contact and less area
coverage. The active layer thickness and the homogeneous horizontal
structure of the overburden material are important parameters
influencing detection of massive ice in permafrost for most methods such
as seismic, TEM, or surface NMR.

	Abstract = {{In the 1940's, several destructive earthquakes occurred in western
Japan. Seismograms in this period were usually recorded on smoked paper
and the quality was poor compared to modern digital data. But the recent
development of image processing technology enabled us to reconstruct
feasible waveform data, whereby we investigated source rupture processes
of two devastating earthquakes: the Tonankai earthquake (M7.9) of
December 7, 1944, and the Mikawa earthquake (M6.8) of January 13, 1945.
The results for the Tonankai earthquake show that the source roughly
consists of a single asperity with a length scale of 100 km, having no
segment structure with a smaller length-scale. Such a feature seems to
be reflected to the sea bottom topography above the source region. The
main source parameters are as follows: the seismic moment = 1.0 {\times}
10$^{21}$ Nm (Mw=7.9); the fault area = 140 km {\times} 80 km;
(strike, dip, rake) = (225{\deg}, 15{\deg}, 79{\deg}); the maximum and
averaged dislocations = 4.4 m and 3.0 m, respectively. The analysis of
the seismograms for the Mikawa earthquake shows that the source is a
reverse fault with a slight left-lateral component. The pressure axis is
directed to ENE-WSW, which is a little rotated from the EW compression
axis prevailing in western Japan. This fault can be regarded as the
southern extension of the Nobi earthquake fault system. The main source
parameters are as follows: the seismic moment = 1.0 {\times}
10$^{19}$ Nm (Mw=6.6); the fault area = 20 km {\times} 15 km;
(strike, dip, rake) = (135{\deg}, 30{\deg}, 65{\deg}); the maximum and
averaged dislocations are 2.1 m and 1.1 m, respectively. The slip
distribution mainly consists of two asperities: the one near the
hypocenter and the other 10-15 km northwest from it. The heavily damaged
area is well correlated with the northwestern asperity.

microwave background and the Type Ia supernovae, the resulting
information clearly indicates that the universe is dominated by dark
components. Even most of cosmic baryons turns out to be dark. In order
to elucidate the nature of dark baryons, we propose a dedicated
soft-X-ray mission, DIOS (Diffuse Intergalactic Oxygen Surveyor). Recent
numerical simulations suggest that approximately 30 to 50 percent of
total baryons at z=0 take the form of the warm-hot intergalactic medium
(WHIM) with 10$^{5}$ K{\lt} T {\lt} 10$^{7}$ K which has
evaded the direct detection so far.  The unprecedented energy resolution
({\tilde} 2eV) of the XSA (X-ray Spectrometer Array) on-board DIOS
enables us to identify WHIM with gas temperature T=10$^{6}${\tilde}
10$^{7}$K and overdensity {$\delta$}=10 {\tilde} 100 located at
z{\lt}0.3 through emission lines of O VII and O VIII. In addition, WHIMs
surrounding nearby clusters are detectable with a typical exposure time
of a day, and thus constitute realistic and promising targets for DIOS.

previously discovered in our SZE map, the temperature inferred after
removing the foreground and background components is well in excess of
20keV, indicating that the cluster has recently undergone a violent
merger. Excluding the region around this subclump, the SZE signals in
submillimeter to centimeter bands (350, 150, and 21GHz) are all
consistent with those expected from Chandra X-ray observations. We
further present a temperature deprojection technique based on the SZE

from the statistics of the underlying dark matter using a cosmological
hydrodynamic simulation of galaxy formation in low-density and spatially

matter cosmogony. Our simulation is based on a
particle-particle-particle-mesh (P$^{3}$M) N-body Poisson solver
and smoothed particle hydrodynamics. Galaxies in our simulation are
identified as clumps of cold and dense gas particles and classified as
young and old galaxies according to their formation epochs. We find that
the pairwise velocity dispersion (PVD) of all galaxies is significantly
lower than that of the dark matter particles and that the PVD of the
young galaxies is lower than that of the old types, and even of all
galaxies together, especially at small separations. These results are in
reasonable agreement with the recent measurements of PVDs in the Las
Campanas redshift survey, the IRAS Point Source Catalogue Redshift
Survey, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. We also find that the low
PVD of young galaxies is due to the effects of dynamical friction as
well as the different spatial distribution, while the difference in the
PVD between all galaxies and dark matter can be mostly ascribed to their
different spatial distributions. We also consider the mean infall
velocity and the POTENT density reconstruction that are often used to
measure the cosmological parameters, and investigate the effects of
spatial bias and dynamical friction. In our simulation, the mean infall
velocity of young galaxies is significantly lower than that of all the
galaxies or of the old galaxies, and the dynamical bias becomes
important on scales less than 3h$^{-1}$Mpc. The mass density field
reconstructed from the velocity field of young galaxies using the
POTENT-style method suffers in accuracy from both the spatial bias and
the dynamical friction on the smoothing scale of
R$_{s}$=8h$^{-1}$Mpc. On the other hand, in the case of
R$_{s}$=12h$^{-1}$Mpc, which is typically adopted in the
actual POTENT analysis, the density reconstruction based on various
tracers of galaxies is reasonably accurate. We also analyze the motions
of central galaxies and the velocity dispersion of galaxies within halos

galaxies and dark halos in a spatially flat, low-density cold dark
matter universe ({$\Omega$}$_{0}$=0.3, {$\lambda$}$_{0}$=0.7,
h=0.7, and {$\sigma$}$_{8}$=1) using cosmological hydrodynamic

particles that satisfy the Jeans criterion. We compare their biasing
properties with the predictions of an analytic halo biasing model. Dark
halos in our simulations exhibit reasonable agreement with the
predictions only on scales larger than \~{}10 h$^{-1}$ Mpc; on
smaller scales, the volume exclusion effect of halos due to their finite
size becomes substantial. Interestingly, the biasing properties of
galaxies are better described by extrapolating the halo biasing model
predictions. The clustering amplitudes of galaxies are almost
independent of the redshift between z=0 and 3, as reported in previous
simulations. This in turn leads to a rapidly evolving biasing factor; we
find that b$_{cov}$\~{}=1 at redshift z\~{}=0 and b$_{cov}$\~{}=3-4
at z=3, where b$_{cov}$ is a biasing parameter defined from the
linear regression of galaxy and dark matter density fields. Those values
are consistent with the observed clustering of Lyman break galaxies. We
also find the clear dependence of galaxy biasing on formation epoch; the
distribution of old populations of galaxies tightly correlates with the
underlying mass density field while that of young populations is
slightly more stochastic and antibiased relative to dark matter. The
amplitude of the two-point correlation function of old populations is
about 3 times larger than that of young populations. Furthermore, the
old population of galaxies resides within massive dark halos while the
young galaxies are preferentially formed in smaller dark halos. Assuming
that the observed early- and late-type galaxies correspond to the
simulated old and young populations of galaxies, respectively, all of
these segregations of galaxies are consistent with observational ones
for early- and late-type galaxies such as, e.g., the morphology-density
relation of galaxies.

from the data which will be obtained by the forthcoming large
submillimeter/millimeter facilities, mainly by the Atacama Submillimeter
Telescope Experiment (ASTE) and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array/Large
Millimeter and Submillimeter Array (ALMA/LMSA). We first calculate the
source counts from 350 {$\mu$}m to 3 mm using the empirical infrared galaxy
number count model of Takeuchi et al. Based on the number counts, we
evaluate the source confusion and determine the confusion limit at
various wave bands as a function of the characteristic beam size. At
submillimeter wavelengths, source confusion with the 10-15 m class
facilities becomes severe at the 0.1-1 mJy level, and astrometry and
flux measurements will be difficult. However, we show that a very large
area survey of submillimeter sources brighter than 10-50 mJy can provide
a unique constraint on infrared galaxy evolution at z=1-2, and such a
survey is suitable for the ASTE. In addition, such a survey enables us
to study the clustering properties of submillimeter sources, which are
still highly unknown. We also find that the 5 {$\sigma$} confusion limit of
LMSA is fainter than 1 {$\mu$}Jy, which enables us to study the
contribution of sources at extremely large redshift. When we discuss
such a deep flux limit, the dynamic range of a detector should be taken
into account, since extremely bright sources make it impossible to
detect the faintest sources near the detection limit. We evaluate the
probability that sources that are 10$^{3}$ times brighter than the
5 {$\sigma$} detection limit of LMSA and ALMA exist in the field of view.
We find that the probability is {\lt}\~{}3{\times}10$^{-4}$, and
therefore we do not have to worry about the dynamic range. The source
counts at such faint flux levels give important information about the
epoch of galaxy formation. We then show that multiband photometry from
the infrared (by ASTRO-F) to the millimeter can be used as a redshift
estimator. We examined the performance of this method by Monte Carlo
simulations and found that it works successfully if we have reasonable
measurement accuracy. In addition, we compare the observed 1.4, 5, and 8
GHz source counts with our model counts to examine the contribution of
star-forming galaxies to faint radio galaxies. We find that the faintest
radio number counts (\~{}1 {$\mu$}Jy) are dominated by actively star-forming

background (CIRB) all suggest that galaxies have experienced strong
evolution sometime in their lifetime. We statistically estimate the
galaxy evolution history from these data. We find that an
order-of-magnitude increase of the far-infrared (FIR) luminosity at
redshift z=0.5-1.0 is necessary to reproduce the very high CIRB
intensity at 140 {$\mu$} m reported by Hauser et al. (1998, AAA
070.161.559) and decreases to, even at most, a factor of 10 toward z--5,
though many variants are allowed within these constraints. This
evolution history also satisfies the constraints from the galaxy number
counts obtained by IRAS, ISO and, roughly, SCUBA. The rapid evolution of
the comoving IR luminosity density required from the CIRB well
reproduces the very steep slope of galaxy number counts obtained by ISO.
We also estimate the cosmic star formation history (SFH) from the
obtained FIR luminosity density, considering the effect of the metal
enrichment in galaxies. The derived SFH increases steeply with redshift
in 0 {\lt} z {\lt} 0.75, and becomes flat or even declines atz {\gt} 0.75 .
This is consistent with the SFH estimated from the reported ultraviolet
luminosity density. In addition, we present the performance of the
Japanese ASTRO-F FIR galaxy survey. We show the expected number counts

derive secure information of galaxy evolution up to z-1 from the survey,

function (LF) of galaxies. We focus on four nonparametric estimators:
the 1/V$_{max}$ estimator, the stepwise maximum-likelihood
estimator, Cho{\l}oniewski's estimator, and the improved Lynden-Bell
estimator. The performance of the 1/V$_{max}$ estimator has
recently been questioned, especially for the faint-end estimation of the
LF. We improve these estimators for studies of the distant universe, and
examine their performances for various classes of functional forms by
Monte Carlo simulations. We also apply these estimation methods to the
mock Two-Degree Field (2dF) redshift survey catalog prepared by Cole et
al. We find that the 1/V$_{max}$ estimator yields a completely
unbiased result if there is no inhomogeneity, but is not robust against
clusters or voids. This is consistent with the well-known results, and
we do not confirm the bias trend of 1/V$_{max}$ claimed by Willmer
in the case of a homogeneous sample. We also find that the other three
maximum-likelihood type estimators are quite robust and give consistent
results with each other. In practice, we recommend Cho{\l}oniewski's
estimator for two reasons: (1) it simultaneously provides the shape and
normalization of the LF; and (2) it is the fastest among these four
estimators, because of its algorithmic simplicity. We then analyze the
photometric redshift data of the Hubble Deep Field prepared by
Fern{\'a}ndez-Soto et al. using the above four methods. We also
derive the luminosity density, {$\rho$}$_{L}$, at the B and I bands.
Our B-band estimation is roughly consistent with that of Sawicki, Lin,

have seven simulation runs with different assumptions about the thermal

coworkers, we modify our SPH algorithm so as to phenomenologically
incorporate galaxy formation by decoupling the cooled gas particles from
the hot gas particles. All the simulations employ 128$^{3}$

constitute the largest systematic catalogs of clusters simulated in the
SPH method performed so far. These enable us to compare the analytical
predictions about statistical properties of X-ray clusters against our
direct simulation results in an unbiased manner. We find that the
luminosities of the simulated clusters are quite sensitive to the
thermal history and also to the numerical resolution of the simulations
and thus are not reliable. On the other hand, the mass-temperature
relation for the simulated clusters is fairly insensitive to the
assumptions of the thermal state of the intracluster gas, is robust
against the numerical resolution, and in fact agrees well with the
analytic prediction. Therefore, prediction of the X-ray temperature

	Abstract = {{We report on the detection of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signals toward
the most luminous X-ray cluster RX J1347-1145 at the Nobeyama Radio
Observatory (21 and 43 GHz) and with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope
(350 GHz). In particular, the latter is the first successful detection
of the SZ temperature increment in the submillimeter band that resolved
the profile of a cluster of galaxies. Both the observed spectral
dependence and the radial profile of the SZ signals are fully consistent
with those expected from the X-ray observation of the cluster. The
combined analysis of the 21 and 350 GHz data reproduces the temperature
and core radius of the cluster that are determined with ROSAT and ASCA
when we adopt the slope of the density profile from the X-ray
observations. Therefore, our present data provide the strongest and most
convincing case for the detection of the submillimeter SZ signal from
the cluster as well as in the Rayleigh-Jeans regime. We also discuss
briefly the cosmological implications of the present results.
