 abstract = "{We examine plasma composition of jets in active galactic nuclei through
the comparison of the total pressure (P) with partial pressures of
electrons and protons in a cocoon. The total pressure is estimated from
the analysis of expanding cocoon dynamics. We determine the average
kinetic energy per particle for several representative cases of particle
energy distribution such as one- and two-temperature thermal plasmas and
non-thermal electrons by evaluating the dissipation of the total kinetic
energy of the jet into the internal energy of cocoon plasma. The number
density of the total electrons/positrons (n $_{±}$) in the
cocoon is constrained by using the particle supply from hot spots and
the absence of thermal bremsstrahlung emission from radio lobes. By
inserting P, n $_{±}$, and the particle energy of each
population into the equation of state, the number density (n$_{p}$
) and pressure (P$_{p}$ ) of protons in the cocoon can be
constrained. Applying this method to Cygnus A, we find that (1)
electron/positron (e $^{±}$) pairs always dominate in terms
of number density, but that (2) either an ''e
$^{±}$-supported cocoon (i.e., P $_{±}$ {\gt}
P$_{p}$ )'' or a ''proton-supported one (i.e., P $_{±}$
{\lt} P$_{p}$ )'' is possible.

 abstract = "{We propose a new method to explore the candidate super-Eddington active
galactic nuclei (AGNs). We examine the properties of infrared (IR)
emission from the inner edge of the dusty torus in AGNs, which are
powered by super- or sub-Eddington accretion flows around black holes,
by considering the dependence of the polar angle on the radiation flux
of accretion flows. We find that for super-Eddington AGNs, of which the
mass accretion rate is more than 10$^{2}$ times larger than the
Eddington rate, the ratio of the AGN IR luminosity and the disc
bolometric luminosity is less than 10$^{-2}$, unless the half
opening angle of the torus ({\thetas}$_{torus}$) is small
({\thetas}$_{torus}$ {\lt} 65{\deg}). This is due to the
self-occultation effect, whereby the self-absorption at the outer region
of the super-Eddington flow dilutes the illumination of the torus. Such
a small luminosity ratio is not observed in sub-Eddington AGNs, whose
mass accretion rate is comparable to or no more than 10 times larger
than the Eddington mass accretion rate, except for extremely thin tori
({\thetas}$_{torus}$ {\gt} 85{\deg}). We also consider the properties
of the near-IR (NIR) emission radiated from hot dust {\gt}1000 K. We find
that super-Eddington AGNs have a ratio of the NIR luminosity to the
bolometric luminosity, L$_{NIR, AGN}$/L$_{bol, disc}$, at
least one order of magnitude smaller than for sub-Eddington AGNs for a
wide range of half opening angle ({\thetas}$_{torus}$ {\gt}
65{\deg}), for various types of dusty torus model. Thus, a relatively low
L$_{NIR, AGN}$/L$_{bol, disc}$ is a property that allows
identification of candidate super-Eddington AGNs. Lastly, we discuss the
possibility that NIR-faint quasars at redshift z{\tilde} 6 discovered by
a recent deep Sloan Digital Sky Survey may be young quasars whose black
holes grow via super-Eddington accretion.

elliptical-dominated host galaxies are more massive than those of
disc-dominated host galaxies statistically. We also found that the SMBH
masses of disc-dominated host galaxies seem to be suppressed even under
increasing starburst luminosity. These findings imply that final SMBH
mass is strongly regulated by host galaxy morphology. This can be
understood by considering the radiation drag model as the SMBH growth
mechanism, taking into account the radiation efficiency of the host
galaxy.

Correspondingly, the lobes initially yield bright bremsstrahlung

detected with Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.

acceleration phase (MSO-FRII phase). The deceleration is caused by the
growth of the cross-sectional area of the cocoon head. Moreover, by
comparing the hot spot speed with the sound speed of the ambient medium,
we predict that only CSOs whose initial advance speed is higher than
0.3-0.5 c can evolve into FRIIs.

gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are likely associated with low metallicity,
rapidly rotating massive stars, we examine the cosmological star
formation rate (SFR) below a critical metallicity Z$_{crit}$ \~{}
1/10-1/5Z$_{solar}$, to estimate the event rate of high redshift
long GRB progenitors. To this purpose, we exploit a galaxy formation
scenario already successfully tested on a wealth of observational data
on (proto)spheroids, Lyman break galaxies, Lyman {$\alpha$} emitters, submm
galaxies, quasars and local early-type galaxies. We find that the
predicted rate of long GRBs amounts to about 300 events yr$^{-1}$
sr$^{-1}$, of which about 30 per cent occur at z {\gt}\~{} 6.
Correspondingly, the GRB number counts well agree with the bright SWIFT
data, without the need for an intrinsic luminosity evolution. Moreover,
the above framework enables us to predict the properties of the GRB host
galaxies. Most GRBs are associated with low-mass galaxy haloes
M$_{H}$ {\lt}\~{} 10$^{11}$M$_{solar}$, and effectively
trace the formation of small galaxies in such haloes. The hosts are
young, with age smaller than 5 {\times} 10$^{7}$ yr, gas rich, but
poorly extincted (A$_{V}$ {\lt}\~{} 0.1) because of their chemical
immaturity; this also implies high specific SFR and quite extreme
{$\alpha$}-enhancement. Only the minority of hosts residing in large haloes
with M$_{H}$ {\gt}\~{} 10$^{12}$M$_{solar}$ has larger
extinction (A$_{V}$ \~{} 0.7 - 1), SFRs exceeding
100M$_{solar}$yr$^{-1}$ and can be detected at submm
wavelengths. Most of the hosts have ultraviolet magnitudes in the range
-20 {\lt}\~{} M$_{1350}$ {\lt}\~{} -16, and Lyman {$\alpha$} luminosity in
the range 2 {\times} 10$^{40}$ {\lt}\~{} L$_{Lymanα}$ {\lt}\~{}
2 {\times} 10$^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$. GRB hosts are thus tracing
the faint end of the luminosity function of Lyman break galaxies and
Lyman {$\alpha$} emitters. Finally, our results imply that the population
of `dark' GRBs occur mostly in faint hosts at high redshift, rather than
in dusty hosts at low redshift.
