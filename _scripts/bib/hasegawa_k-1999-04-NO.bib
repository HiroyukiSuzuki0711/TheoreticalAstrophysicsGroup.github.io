 abstract = "{The Double Helix Nebula (DHN), located 100 pc above Sgr A* in the
Galactic center (GC), is a unique structure whose morphology suggests it
is a magnetic feature. Recent molecular observations toward the DHN
revealed two candidate molecular counterparts of the DHN at radial
velocities of {\ndash}35 km s$^{--1}$ and 0 km
s$^{--1}$ and discussed the model in which the DHN has its
origin at the circumnuclear disk in the GC. In this paper, new CO
observations toward the DHN using the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory
and Mopra telescopes are presented. The higher-resolution observations
of \~{}1 pc scale reveal the detailed distributions and kinematics of the
two CO counterparts (the 0 km s$^{--1}$ and {\ndash}35 km
s$^{--1}$ features) and provide new information on their
physical conditions. As a result, we find that the 0 km
s$^{--1}$ feature with a mass of 3.3 {\times} 10$^{4}$ M
$_{&#9737;}$ coincides with the infrared emission of the DHN,
indicating clear association with the DHN. The association of the
{\ndash}35 km s$^{--1}$ feature, with a mass of 0.8 {\times}
10$^{4}$ M $_{&#9737;}$, is less clear compared with the 0
km s$^{--1}$ feature, but the complementary distribution
between the molecular gas and the DHN and velocity variation along the
DHN support its association with the DHN. The two molecular features are
highly excited, as shown by the relatively high CO J = 2-1/J = 1-0
intensity ratios of \~{}1.0, and have kinetic temperatures of \~{}30 K,
consistent with the typical molecular clouds in the GC.

toward the super star cluster NGC 3603 in the transitions
$^{12}$CO(J = 2-1, J = 1-0) and $^{13}$CO(J = 2-1, J = 1-0).
We suggest that two molecular clouds at 13 km s$^{-1}$ and
28 km s$^{-1}$ are associated with NGC 3603 as evidenced by
higher temperatures toward the H II region, as well as morphological
correspondence. The mass of the clouds is too small to gravitationally
bind them, given their relative motion of \~{}20 km s$^{-1}$.
We suggest that the two clouds collided with each other 1 Myr ago to
trigger the formation of the super star cluster. This scenario is able
to explain the origin of the highest mass stellar population in the
cluster, which is as young as 1 Myr and is segregated within the central
sub-pc of the cluster. This is the second super star cluster along with
Westerlund 2 where formation may have been triggered by a cloud-cloud
collision.

 abstract = "{We present a novel radiation hydrodynamics code, START, which is a
smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme coupled with accelerated
radiative transfer. The basic idea for the acceleration of radiative
transfer is parallel to the tree algorithm that is hitherto used to
speed up the gravitational force calculation in an N-body system. It is
demonstrated that the radiative transfer calculations can be
dramatically accelerated, where the computational time is scaled as
N$_{p}$ logN$_{s}$ for N$_{p}$ SPH particles and
N$_{s}$ radiation sources. Such acceleration allows us to readily
include not only numerous sources but also scattering photons, even if
the total number of radiation sources is comparable to that of SPH
particles. Here, a test simulation is presented for a multiple source
problem, where the results with START are compared to those with a
radiation SPH code without tree-based acceleration. We find that the
results agree well with each other if we set the tolerance parameter as
{\thetas}$_{crit}$ {\lt}= 1.0, and then it demonstrates that START
can solve radiative transfer faster without reducing the accuracy. One
of the important applications with START is to solve the transfer of
diffuse ionizing photons, where each SPH particle is regarded as an
emitter. To illustrate the competence of START, we simulate the
shadowing effect by dense clumps around an ionizing source. As a result,
it is found that the erosion of shadows by diffuse recombination photons
can be solved. Such an effect is of great significance to reveal the
cosmic reionization process.

 abstract = "{We explore the impact of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from massive
Population III (Pop III) stars of 25, 40, 80 and 120M$_{solar}$ on
the subsequent Pop III star formation. In this paper, particular
attention is paid to the dependence of radiative feedback on the mass of
source Pop III star. UV radiation from the source star can work to
impede the secondary star formation through the photoheating and
photodissociation processes. Recently, Susa and Umemura have shown that
the ionizing radiation alleviates the negative effect by
H$_{2}$-dissociating radiation from 120M$_{solar}$ Pop III
star, since an H$_{2}$ shell formed ahead of an ionizing front can
effectively shield H$_{2}$-dissociating radiation. On the other
hand, it is expected that the negative feedback by
H$_{2}$-dissociating radiation can be predominant if a source star
is less massive, since a ratio of the H$_{2}$-dissociating photon
number to the ionizing photon number becomes higher. In order to
investigate the radiative feedback effects from such less massive stars,
we perform three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations,
incorporating the radiative transfer effect of ionizing and
H$_{2}$-dissociating radiation. As a result, we find that if a
source star is less massive than \~{}25M$_{solar}$, the ionizing
radiation cannot suppress the negative feedback of
H$_{2}$-dissociating radiation. Therefore, the fate of the
neighbouring clouds around such less massive stars is determined solely
by the flux of H$_{2}$-dissociating radiation from source stars.
By making analytic estimates of H$_{2}$ shell formation and its
shielding effect, we derive the criteria for radiation hydrodynamic
feedback depending on the source star mass.
