rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) for determining spectroscopic redshift of
z {\gt} 8 galaxies with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array

metallicity, especially for the [O III] 88 {$\mu$}m line which is likely to
be the strongest FIR line from H II regions, we predict the line fluxes
from high-z galaxies based on a cosmological hydrodynamics simulation of
galaxy formation. Since the metallicity of galaxies reaches at \~{}0.2 Z
$_{⊙}$ even at z {\gt} 8 in our simulation, we expect the [O
III] 88 {$\mu$}m line as strong as 1.3 mJy for 27 AB objects, which is
detectable at a high significance by {\lt}1 hr integration with ALMA.
Therefore, the [O III] 88 {$\mu$}m line would be the best tool to confirm
the spectroscopic redshifts beyond z = 8.

the present method, we calculate the displacement discontinuity along an
isolated crack caused by harmonic waves using the method, which is

integral equation method. The test resultantly indicates that the
present method yields sufficient accuracy. As an application of this

distributed cracks. We experimentally determine the attenuation and
velocity dispersion induced by scattering from the synthetic

if the crack density is sufficiently low. The theory appears valid with
a crack density up to at least 0.1 for SV wave incidence, whereas the
validity limit appears lower for P wave incidence.

to simulate the formation of a galaxy in the {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter
structure formation paradigm. The various runs (13 in total) differ in
their numerical hydrodynamical treatment [smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH), moving mesh and adaptive mesh refinement] but share
the same initial conditions and adopt in each case their latest
published model of gas cooling, star formation and feedback. Despite the
common halo assembly history, we find large code-to-code variations in
the stellar mass, size, morphology and gas content of the galaxy at z=
0, due mainly to the different implementations of star formation and
feedback. Compared with observation, most codes tend to produce an
overly massive galaxy, smaller and less gas rich than typical spirals,
with a massive bulge and a declining rotation curve. A stellar disc is
discernible in most simulations, although its prominence varies widely
from code to code. There is a well-defined trend between the effects of
feedback and the severity of the disagreement with observed spirals. In
general, models that are more effective at limiting the baryonic mass of
the galaxy come closer to matching observed galaxy scaling laws, but
often to the detriment of the disc component. Although numerical
convergence is not particularly good for any of the codes, our
conclusions hold at two different numerical resolutions. Some
differences can also be traced to the different numerical techniques;
for example, more gas seems able to cool and become available for star
formation in grid-based codes than in SPH. However, this effect is small
compared to the variations induced by different feedback prescriptions.
We conclude that state-of-the-art simulations cannot yet uniquely
predict the properties of the baryonic component of a galaxy, even when
the assembly history of its host halo is fully specified. Developing
feedback algorithms that can effectively regulate the mass of a galaxy
without hindering the formation of high angular momentum stellar discs
remains a challenge.

we find that the condensation of baryons has had a relatively minor
effect on the structure of the satellites' dark matter haloes. The
stellar mass that forms in each satellite agrees relatively well over
three levels of resolution (a factor of {\tilde}64 in particle mass) and
scales with (sub)halo mass in a similar way in an independent
semi-analytical model. Our model provides a relatively good match to the
average luminosity function of the MW and M31. To establish whether the
potential wells of our satellites are realistic, we measure their masses
within observationally determined half-light radii, finding that they
have somewhat higher mass-to-light ratios than those derived for the MW
dSphs from stellar kinematic data; the most massive examples are most
discrepant. A statistical test yields an {\tilde}6 per cent probability
that the simulated and observationally derived distributions of masses
are consistent. If the satellite population of the MW is typical, our
results could imply that feedback processes not properly captured by our
simulations have reduced the central densities of subhaloes, or that
they initially formed with lower concentrations, as would be the case,
for example, if the dark matter were made of warm, rather than cold
particles.

the inversion of real data, we confirm macroscopic features, such as a
long duration ({\tilde}165 s) and a slow rupture velocity ({\tilde}1.25
km/s). The region of the initial rupture is found to be isolated from
the eastern broad region in which we further identify a heterogeneous
slip distribution. Most of these regions are likely to be at the
sedimentary plate interface where the accreted sediment and the
subducting plate are in contact. In particular, the nearly ``isolated''
feature of a shallow slip region suggests a possible faulting in the
shallowest part of the sedimentary plate interface without being
strongly enforced by the rupture propagated from the deeper part of the
fault. Such heterogeneity suggests a highly variable frictional behavior
at the sedimentary plate interface.

moment tensor inversion method that can generate the Green's functions

realistic inhomogeneous structure by only three finite difference
calculations per a single station. The inversion with a grid search
scheme result in a reasonable source location, moment tensor and fit of
