 abstract = "{We perform N-body simulations on a multiple massive black hole (MBH)
system in a host galaxy to derive the criteria for successive MBH
merger. The calculations incorporate the dynamical friction by stars and
general relativistic effects as pericentre shift and gravitational wave
recoil. The orbits of MBHs are pursed down to 10 Schwarzschild radii
({\tilde}1 au). As a result, it is shown that about a half of MBHs merge
during 1 Gyr in a galaxy with mass 10$^{11}$ M$_{&sun;}$ and
stellar velocity dispersion 240 km s$^{-1}$, even if the recoil
velocity is two times as high as the stellar velocity dispersion. The
dynamical friction allows a binary MBH to interact frequently with other
MBHs, and then the decay of the binary orbits leads to the merger
through gravitational wave radiation, as shown by Tanikawa {\amp}
Umemura. We derive the MBH merger criteria for the masses, sizes, and
luminosities of host galaxies. It is found that the successive MBH
mergers are expected in bright galaxies, depending on redshifts.
Furthermore, we find that the central stellar density is reduced by the
sling-shot mechanism and that high-velocity stars with {\tilde}1000 km
s$^{-1}$ are generated intermittently in extremely radial orbits.

 abstract = "{We have performed N-body simulations of globular clusters (GCs) in order
to estimate a detection rate of mergers of binary stellar mass black
holes (BBHs) by means of gravitational wave (GW) observatories. For our
estimate, we have only considered mergers of BBHs which escape from GCs
(BBH escapers). BBH escapers merge more quickly than BBHs inside GCs
because of their small semimajor axes. N-body simulation cannot deal
with a GC with the number of stars N {\tilde} 10$^{6}$ due to its
high calculation cost. We have simulated dynamical evolution of small N
clusters (10$^{4}$ {\lsim} N {\lsim} 10$^{5}$), and have
extrapolated our simulation results to large N clusters. From our
simulation results, we have found the following dependence of BBH
properties on N. BBHs escape from a cluster at each two-body relaxation
time at a rate proportional to N. Semimajor axes of BBH escapers are
inversely proportional to N, if initial mass densities of clusters are
fixed. Eccentricities, primary masses and mass ratios of BBH escapers
are independent of N. Using this dependence of BBH properties, we have
artificially generated a population of BBH escapers from a GC with N
{\tilde} 10$^{6}$, and have estimated a detection rate of mergers
of BBH escapers by next-generation GW observatories. We have assumed
that all the GCs are formed 10 or 12 Gyr ago with their initial numbers
of stars N$_{i}$ = 5 {\times} 10$^{5}$-2 {\times}
10$^{6}$ and their initial stellar mass densities inside their
half-mass radii {$\rho$}$_{h,i}$ = 6 {\times}
10$^{3}$-10$^{6}$ M$_{&sun;}$ pc$^{-3}$. Then,
the detection rate of BBH escapers is 0.5-20 yr$^{-1}$ for a BH
retention fraction R$_{BH}$ = 0.5. A few BBH escapers are
components of hierarchical triple systems, although we do not consider
secular perturbation on such BBH escapers for our estimate. Our
simulations have shown that BHs are still inside some of GCs at the
present day. These BHs may marginally contribute to BBH detection.

 abstract = "{Using highly accurate N-body simulations, we explore the evolution of
multiple massive black holes (hereafter MBHs) in a primordial galaxy
that is composed of stars and MBHs. The evolution is pursed with a
fourth-order Hermite scheme, where not only three-body interaction of
MBHs but also dynamical friction by stars are incorporated. Initially,
10 MBHs with equal masses of 10$^{7}$ M $_{sun}$ are set in
a host galaxy with 10$^{11}$ M $_{sun}$. It is found that
4-6 MBHs merge successively within 1 Gyr, emitting gravitational wave
radiation. The key process for the successive merger of MBHs is the
dynamical friction by field stars, which enhances three-body
interactions of MBHs when they enter the central regions of the galaxy.
The heaviest MBH always composes a close binary at the galactic center,
which shrinks owing to the angular momentum transfer by the third MBH
and eventually merges. The angular momentum transfer by the third MBH is
due to the sling-shot mechanism. We find that the secular Kozai
mechanism does not work for a binary to merge if we include the
relativistic pericenter shift. The simulations show that a multiple MBH
system can produce a heavier MBH at the galactic center purely through
N-body process. This merger path can be of great significance for the
growth of MBHs in a primordial galaxy. The merger of multiple MBHs may
be a potential source of gravitational waves for the Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna and pulsar timing.
