    title = "{Crucial effect of system compliance on the maximum stress estimation in the hydrofracturing method: Theoretical considerations and field-test verification}",

   volume = 58,
    pages = {963-971},
 abstract = "{Why do the currently available data sets from field hydrofracturing
tests indicate that the measured re-opening pressure lies close to the
shut-in pressure far more often than can reasonably be expected? In
order to explain such a strange phenomenon, it is necessary to take into
consideration two additional factors, those of (1) a residual aperture
of fracture and (2) hydraulic compliance of the test equipment, both of
which are ignored in the conventional theory of hydraulic fracturing.
The residual aperture causes pressure penetration into the fracture
prior to opening, and its effect is to reduce the re-opening pressure by
a factor of two from the value expected when the conventional theory is
used. The conventional theory implies that the fracture always begins to
open at a borehole pressure less than the shut-in pressure. However, due
to the effect of large hydraulic compliance, the reopening pressure
measured in the conventional manner becomes larger than the true
reopening pressure and approaches the shut-in pressure. Contrary to
this, the reopening pressure measured using the test equipment with
sufficiently small compliance represents a good estimate of the true
reopening pressure. This pressure is related to the maximum horizontal
stress S$_{H}$, and its measured value allows us to estimate the
value of S$_{H}$.
