 abstract = "{We investigate the gas supply process from a nuclear gas disk to the
Galactic center by performing two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations
including self-gravity and radiative cooling. We assume that the gas is
supplied to the nuclear gas disk by the host galaxy disk. We show that
many gas clumps are formed in the nuclear gas disk after the nuclear gas
disk becomes massive enough to become gravitationally unstable.
Coalescence of the gas clumps leads to the formation of more massive gas
clumps. Gravitational encounters between these massive gas clumps induce
angular momentum transfer between the gas clumps. Massive gas clumps
that lose their angular momentum due to gravitational encounters move to
the galactic center. In this way, the gas supply to the galactic center
is realized. We also perform a numerical simulation with twice the
spatial resolution to check numerical resolution effects. Time evolution
of azimuthally averaged surface density distributions in both models
agree well with each other. The high-mass part of the clump mass
function in the low-resolution model is in good agreement with that of
the high-resolution model, and lower mass clumps are well resolved in
the high-resolution model. Therefore, we conclude that massive gas
clumps play a major role in the angular momentum transfer. The gas
supply rate to the center is about half of the gas supply rate from the
host galaxy when the whole region of the nuclear gas disk becomes
self-gravitationally unstable. More massive gas clumps are formed and
migrate to the Galactic center in the models of the higher gas supply
rate from the host galaxy.

 abstract = "{We investigate a rapid mass supply process by nested bars in the Galaxy
by numerical simulation. We simulate gas flow in the whole Galaxy disk
with nested bars, which are the outer bar and the inner bar, with a high
spatial resolution in the Galactic central region. We assume two cases
of the inner bar size: one smaller and one larger than the radius of the
200 pc gas ring which corresponds to the central molecular zone. From
our numerical results, in the large size bar cases, the inner bars with
large elongation induce sufficient mass inflow and destroy the 200 pc
gas ring. On the other hand, in the small size bar cases, the inner bars
with large elongation induce large mass inflow and do not destroy the
200 pc gas ring. This mass inflow is caused by straight shocks excited
by the inner bar. In this case, nuclear gas disks of \~{}15 pc radius are
formed. The nuclear gas disks are self-gravitationally unstable and we
expect the formation of compact star clusters under a strong tidal force
in the nuclear gas disks. We discuss the evolution of the nuclear gas
disk.
