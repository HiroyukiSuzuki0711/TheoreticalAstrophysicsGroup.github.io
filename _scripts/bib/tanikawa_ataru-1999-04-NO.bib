 abstract = "{At the moment of deepest core collapse, a star cluster core contains
less than ten stars. This small number makes the traditional treatment
of hard binary formation, assuming a homogeneous background density,
suspect. In a previous paper, we have found that indeed the conventional
wisdom of binary formation, based on three-body encounters, is
incorrect. Here we refine that insight, by further dissecting the
subsequent steps leading to hard binary formation. For this purpose, we
add some analysis tools in order to make the study less subjective. We
find that the conventional treatment does remain valid for direct
three-body scattering, but fails for resonant three-body scattering.
Especially democratic resonance scattering, which forms an important
part of the analytical theory of three-body binary formation, takes too
much space and time to be approximated as being isolated, in the context
of a cluster core around core collapse. We conclude that, while
three-body encounters can be analytically approximated as isolated,
subsequent strong perturbations typically occur whenever those
encounters give rise to democratic resonances. We present analytical
estimates postdicting our numerical results. If we only had been a bit
more clever, we could have predicted this qualitative behaviour.

 abstract = "{We have developed a numerical software library for collisionless N-body
simulations named ''Phantom-GRAPE'' which highly accelerates force
calculations among particles by use of a new SIMD instruction set
extension to the x86 architecture, Advanced Vector eXtensions (AVX), an
enhanced version of the Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE). In our library,
not only the Newton's forces, but also central forces with an arbitrary
shape f(r), which has a finite cutoff radius r$_{cut}$ (i.e.
f(r)=0 at r{\gt}r$_{cut}$), can be quickly computed. In computing
such central forces with an arbitrary force shape f(r), we refer to a
pre-calculated look-up table. We also present a new scheme to create the
look-up table whose binning is optimal to keep good accuracy in
computing forces and whose size is small enough to avoid cache misses.
Using an Intel Core i7-2600 processor, we measure the performance of our
library for both of the Newton's forces and the arbitrarily shaped
central forces. In the case of Newton's forces, we achieve
2{\times}10$^{9}$ interactions per second with one processor core
(or 75 GFLOPS if we count 38 operations per interaction), which is 20
times higher than the performance of an implementation without any
explicit use of SIMD instructions, and 2 times than that with the SSE
instructions. With four processor cores, we obtain the performance of
8{\times}10$^{9}$ interactions per second (or 300 GFLOPS). In the
case of the arbitrarily shaped central forces, we can calculate
1{\times}10$^{9}$ and 4{\times}10$^{9}$ interactions per
second with one and four processor cores, respectively. The performance
with one processor core is 6 times and 2 times higher than those of the
implementations without any use of SIMD instructions and with the SSE
instructions. These performances depend only weakly on the number of
particles, irrespective of the force shape. It is good contrast with the
fact that the performance of force calculations accelerated by graphics
processing units (GPUs) depends strongly on the number of particles.
Substantially weak dependence of the performance on the number of
particles is suitable to collisionless N-body simulations, since these
simulations are usually performed with sophisticated N-body solvers such
as Tree- and TreePM-methods combined with an individual timestep scheme.
We conclude that collisionless N-body simulations accelerated with our
library have significant advantage over those accelerated by GPUs,
especially on massively parallel environments.

 abstract = "{The conventional wisdom for the formation of the first hard binary in
core collapse is that three-body interactions of single stars form many
soft binaries, most of which are quickly destroyed, but eventually one
of them survives. We report on direct N-body simulations to test these
ideas, for the first time. We find that the assumptions are incorrect in
the majority of the cases: (1) quite a few three-body interactions
produce a hard binary from scratch; (2) in many cases there are more
than three bodies directly and simultaneously involved in the production
of the first binary. The main reason for the discrepancies is that the
core of a star cluster, at the first deep collapse, contains typically
only five or so stars. Therefore, the homogeneous background assumption,
which still would be reasonable for, say, 25 stars, utterly breaks down.
There have been some speculations in this direction, but we demonstrate
this result here explicitly, for the first time.

processor core of Intel Core i7-2600 processor (8 MB cache and 3.40 GHz)
based on Sandy Bridge micro-architecture, we implemented a fourth-order
Hermite scheme with individual timestep scheme ( Makino and Aarseth,
1992), and achieved the performance of {\tilde}20 giga floating point
number operations per second (GFLOPS) for double-precision accuracy,
which is two times and five times higher than that of the previously
developed code implemented with the SSE instructions ( Nitadori et al.,
2006b), and that of a code implemented without any explicit use of SIMD
instructions with the same processor core, respectively. We have
parallelized the code by using so-called NINJA scheme ( Nitadori et al.,
2006a), and achieved {\tilde}90 GFLOPS for a system containing more than
N = 8192 particles with 8 MPI processes on four cores. We expect to
achieve about 10 tera FLOPS (TFLOPS) for a self-gravitating collisional
system with N {\tilde} 10 $^{5}$ on massively parallel systems with
at most 800 cores with Sandy Bridge micro-architecture. This performance
will be comparable to that of Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) cluster
systems, such as the one with about 200 Tesla C1070 GPUs ( Spurzem et
al., 2010). This paper offers an alternative to collisional N-body
simulations with GRAPEs and GPUs.

 abstract = "{We investigate the long-term dynamical evolution of star clusters in a
steady tidal field produced by its parent galaxy. In this paper, we
focus on the influence of the mass profile of the parent galaxy.
Previous studies were done with simplification, where the parent galaxy
was expressed by the point mass. We express different mass profiles of
the parent galaxy by the tidal fields in which the ratios of the
epicyclic frequency, {$\kappa$}, to the angular velocity, {$\omega$} are
different. We compare the mass-loss timescale of star clusters whose
tidal radii are identical, but in parent galaxies with different mass
profiles, by means of orbits calculations in fixed cluster potential and
N-body simulations. In this situation, a cluster rotates around the
parent galaxy more rapidly, since the parent galaxy has a shallower mass
profile. We found that the mass-loss timescale increase by 20\% and 50\%
for the cases that the mass-density profiles of the parent galaxies are
proportional to R$^{-2}$ and R$^{-1.5}$, where R is the
distance from the galaxy center, compared to the point-mass case, in a
moderately strong tidal field. Counterintuitively, a cluster that
rotates around the parent galaxy more rapidly has a longer lifetime. The
increase of the lifetime is due to the fact that the fraction occupied
by a regular-like orbit increases in a shallower profile. Finally, we
derive an evaluation formula for the mass-loss timescale of clusters.
Our formula can explain a property of the population of the observed
galactic globular clusters, that their half-mass radii become smaller as
their distances from the galactic center become smaller.

Using a newly developed code, GORILLA, we simulated eleven N = 16384
clusters with primordial binaries whose binding energies are equal in
each cluster in the range of 1--300kT$_{0}$, where
1.5kT$_{0}$ is the average stellar kinetic energy at the initial
time. We found that, in both the soft ({\le}3kT$_{0}$) and hard
({\ge}300kT$_{0}$) limits, clusters experience deep core collapse.
For intermediate hardness (10--100kT$_{0}$), the core collapses
halt halfway due to an energy releases of the primordial binaries. The
core radii at the halt can be explained by their energy budget.

cluster models, whose central concentration and strength of the tidal
field are different. We found that the mass-loss timescale due to the
escape of stars, t$_{mloss}$, and its dependence on the two-body
relaxation timescale, t$_{rh, i}$, are determined by the strength
of the tidal field. The logarithmic slope [{\equiv} d ln(t
$_{mloss}$)/d ln(t$_{rh, i}$)] approaches unity for the
cluster models in weaker tidal fields. The timescale and the dependence
are almost independent of the central concentration for clusters in
tidal fields of the same strength. In our results, the scaling found by
Baumgardt (2001, MNRAS, 325, 1323) can be seen only in cluster models
with moderately strong tidal fields.
