 abstract = "{Galaxies and massive black holes (BHs) presumably grow via galactic
merging events and subsequent BH coalescence. As a case study, we
investigate the merging event between the Andromeda galaxy (M31) and a
satellite galaxy. We compute the expected observational appearance of
the massive BH that was at the center of the satellite galaxy prior to
the merger and is currently wandering in the M31 halo. We demonstrate
that a radiatively inefficient accretion flow with a bolometric
luminosity of a few tens of solar luminosities develops when
Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion onto the BH is assumed. We compute the
associated broadband spectrum and show that the radio band (observable
with EVLA, ALMA, and the Square Kilometre Array) is the best frequency
range in which to detect the emission. We also evaluate the mass and the
luminosity of the stars bound by the wandering BH and find that such a
star cluster is sufficiently luminous that it could correspond to one of
the star clusters found by the PAndAS survey. The discovery of a relic
massive BH wandering in a galactic halo will provide a direct means of
investigating in detail the coevolution of galaxies and BHs. It also
means a new population of BHs (off-center massive BHs) and offers
targets for clean BH imaging that avoid strong interstellar scattering
in the centers of galaxies.

 abstract = "{In the hierarchical structure formation scenario, galaxies enlarge
through multiple merging events with less massive galaxies. In addition,
the Magorrian relation indicates that almost all galaxies are occupied
by a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) of mass
10$^{-3}$ times the mass of its spheroidal component.
Consequently, SMBHs are expected to wander in the halos of their host
galaxies following a galaxy collision, although evidence of this
activity is currently lacking. We investigate a current plausible
location of an SMBH wandering in the halo of the Andromeda galaxy (M31).
According to theoretical studies of N-body simulations, some of the many
substructures in the M31 halo are remnants of a minor merger occurring
about 1 Gyr ago. First, to evaluate the possible parameter space of the
infalling orbit of the progenitor, we perform numerous parameter studies
using a graphics processing unit cluster. To reduce uncertainties in the
predicted position of the expected SMBH, we then calculate the time
evolution of the SMBH in the progenitor dwarf galaxy from N-body
simulations using the plausible parameter sets. Our results show that
the SMBH lies within the halo (\~{}20-50 kpc from the M31 center), closer
to the Milky Way than the M31 disk. Furthermore, the predicted current
positions of the SMBH were restricted to an observational field of
0.{\deg}6 {\times} 0.{\deg}7 in the northeast region of the M31 halo. We
also discuss the origin of the infalling orbit of the satellite galaxy
and its relationships with the recently discovered vast thin disk plane
of satellite galaxies around M31.
