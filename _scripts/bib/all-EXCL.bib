	Abstract = {{We propose a new evolutionary model of a supermassive black hole (SMBH)
and a circumnuclear disk (CND), taking into account the mass-supply from
a host galaxy and the physical states of CND. In the model, two distinct
accretion modes depending on gravitational stability of the CND play a
key role on accreting gas  to a SMBH. (i) If the CND is gravitationally
unstable, energy feedback from supernovae (SNe) supports a geometrically
thick, turbulent gas disk. The accretion in this mode is dominated by
turbulent viscosity, and it is significantly larger than that in the
mode (ii), i.e.,  the CND is supported by gas pressure. Once the gas
supply from the host is stopped, the high accretion phase changes to the
low one  (mode (ii)), but there is a delay with {\tilde} 10$^{8}$
yr. Through this evolution, the gas-rich CND turns into the gas poor
stellar disk.  We found that not all the gas supplied from the host
galaxy to the central 100 pc region accrete onto the SMBH even in the
high accretion phase (mode (i)), because  the part of gas is used to
form stars. Moreover, a super-Eddington accretion is possible in the
high accretion phase and thus the its condition is briefly discussed.

hot spot radius and the linear size of radio sources, in order to reveal
how compact symmetric objects (CSOs) evolve into Fanaroff-Riley type II
(FRII) radio sources, passing through medium-size symmetric objects
(MSOs). Comparing with a dynamical model taking into account of the head
growth of radio lobes, we predict that the advance speed of hot spots
and lobes inevitably show a deceleration phase (CSO-MSO phase) and an
acceleration phase (MSO-FRII phase). This is ascribed to the sharp
change of ambient matter density in the MSO phase ({\tilde} 1 kpc). Based
on our findings, we finally discuss the fate of CSOs.

new way. We model the dynamical expansion of its cocoon embedded in the
intra-cluster medium (ICM). By comparing the observed shape of the
cocoon with that expected from the theoretical model, we estimate the
total pressure (Pc) and electron temperature (Te) of the cocoon. The
number density of the total electrons (ne$^{-}$) is constrained by
using the non-thermal spectrum of the hot spot and the analysis of the
momentum balance between the jet thrust and the rum pressure of ICM.
Together with the obtained Pc, Te and ne$^{-}$, we constrain the
matter content in the jets. We find that, in the case of Cygnus A, the
ratio of number density of protons to that of electrons is of order of
10$^{-3}$ . This implies the existence of a large number of
positron in the jet.

hydrodynamic process for the growth of SMBH in the optically thick

accretion on to a galactic center through radiation drag effect. In the
present scenario, the AGN luminosity-dominant phase (QSO phase) is
preceded by the host luminosity-dominat phase, which is called

Furthermore, such radiation hydrodynamic model has been also applied to
disk galaxies. It turns out that the mass of a SMBH primarily correlates
with a bulge component even in a disk galaxy. Thus, by analogy to
proto-QSOs, the BH growing phase in disk galaxies may have massive dusty
disks within younger bulges.

result, it is found that after a galactic wind epoch, the luminosity is
shifted from the host-dominant phase to the AGN-dominant phase (QSO

corresponds to the early stage of BH growth, and can be regarded as a

formation simulations, previous studies can not consider multiphase
structures of the ISM which should strongly affect galaxy properties.
For instance, the size of disk galaxies formed in numerical simulations
is smaller than that of observed galaxies.

In this study, by increasing the numerical resolution, we take into
account the multiphase structure of ISM produced by radiative cooling,
UV heating and supernova feedback. We simulate evolutions of multiphase
ISM in a gas-rich dwarf galaxy, and obtain various aspects corresponding
to gas-rich dwarf galaxies, especially, giant molecular cloud
associations and superbubbles produced by subsequent supernovae.

The cloud mass function in our models has a power law form with index
{$\alpha$} {\tilde}-1.7 which agrees well with the observed values {$\alpha$}
{\tilde} -1.5 to -2.0. The bubble size approximately corresponds to the
scale height of a warm (10$^{3}$ K{\lt} T{\lt}10$^{4}$ K)

	Abstract = {{We study the formation histories and present-day structure of galactic
subsystems formed in a high resolution hydrodynamic simulation of a
Milky Way-sized galaxy. The simulated satellites span nearly 4 orders of
magnitude in luminosity but have a very similar mass within their inner
600 pc with very little scatter. This is in agreement with the recent
measurements for dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Interestingly,
subhaloes with circular velocity around 20 km/s sometimes host
satellites that are as bright as the classical satellites and sometimes
they are found as completely dark objects. We find that there is a
critical circular velocity at the epoch of reionization, below which
haloes fail to host star formation and found as ``dark satellites''
today.

	Abstract = {{This paper describes our experience making a short stereoscopic movie
visualizing the development of structure in the universe during the 13.7
billion years from the Big Bang to the present day. Aimed at a general
audience for the Royal Society's 2005 Summer Science Exhibition, the
movie illustrates how the latest cosmological theories based on dark
matter and dark energy are capable of producing structures as complex as
spiral galaxies and allows the viewer to directly compare observations
from the real universe with theoretical results. 3D is an inherent
feature of the cosmology data sets and stereoscopic visualization
provides a natural way to present the images to the viewer, in addition
to allowing researchers to visualize these vast, complex data sets. The
presentation of the movie used passive, linearly polarized projection
onto a 2m wide screen but it was also required to playback on a Sharp
RD3D display and in anaglyph projection at venues without dedicated
stereoscopic display equipment. Additionally lenticular prints were made
from key images in the movie. We discuss the following technical
challenges during the stereoscopic production process; 1) Controlling
the depth presentation, 2) Editing the stereoscopic sequences, 3)
Generating compressed movies in display specific formats. We conclude
that the generation of high quality stereoscopic movie content using
desktop tools and equipment is feasible. This does require careful
quality control and manual intervention but we believe these overheads
are worthwhile when presenting inherently 3D data as the result is
significantly increased impact and better understanding of complex 3D
scenes.

	Abstract = {{We investigate environmental effects on evolution of bright cluster
galaxies in a {$\Lambda$}-dominated cold dark matter universe using a
combination of dissipationless N-body simulations and a semi-analytic
galaxy formation model. We incorporate effects of ram-pressure stripping
(RPS) and minor merger-induced small starburst (minor burst) into our
model. By considering minor burst, the observed morphology-radius
relation is successfully reproduced. When we do not consider minor
burst, the RPS hardly increases the intermediate B/T population. In
addition, the RPS and minor burst are not important for colours or star
formation rates of galaxies in the cluster core if star formation
time-scale is properly chosen, because the star formation is
sufficiently suppressed by consumption of the cold gas. We also find
that SF in bulge-dominated galaxies is mainly terminated by starburst
induced by major mergers in all environments.
