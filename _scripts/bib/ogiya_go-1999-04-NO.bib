 abstract = "{Observations have revealed interesting universal properties of dark
matter (DM) haloes especially around low-mass galaxies. Strigari et al.
showed that DM haloes have common enclosed masses within 300 pc
(Strigari relation). Kormendy {\amp} Freeman reported DM haloes having
almost identical central surface densities (the {$\mu$}$_{0D}$
relation). In addition, there exists a core-cusp problem, a discrepancy
of the central density distribution between simulated haloes and
observations. We investigate whether a scenario where cuspy haloes
transform into cores by some dynamical processes can also explain their
universal structural properties. It is shown that a cusp-to-core
transformation model naturally reproduces the {$\mu$}$_{0D}$ relation
and that Strigari relation follows from the {$\mu$}$_{0D}$ relation
for dwarf galaxies. We also show that the central densities of cored
dark haloes provide valuable information about their formation
redshifts. L121

 abstract = "{The core-cusp problem remains as one of the unsolved discrepancies
between observations and theories predicted by the standard paradigm of
cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology. To solve this problem, we perform
N-body simulations to study the nonlinear response of CDM halos to the
variance of the gravitational potential induced by gas removal from
galaxy centers. In this study, we focus on the timescale of the gas
ejection, which is strongly correlated with stellar activities, and
demonstrate that it is one of the key factors in determining the
dynamical response of CDM halos. The results of simulations show that
the power-law index of the mass-density profile of the dark matter (DM)
halo is correlated with the timescale of the mass loss and it is flatter
when the mass loss occurs over a short time than when it occurs over a
long time. However, it is still larger than typical observational
values; in other words, the central cusp remains in the simulations for
any mass-loss model. Moreover, for the slow mass-loss case, the final
density profile of the DM halo recovers the universal density profiles
predicted by the CDM cosmology. Therefore, the mass loss driven by
stellar feedback may not be an effective mechanism to flatten the
central cusp.
