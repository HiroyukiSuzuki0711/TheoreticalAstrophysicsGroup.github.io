 abstract = "{We observed cross sectional ultra-thin sections near the surface of 12
particles recovered from the S-type asteroid Itokawa by the Hayabusa
spacecraft in 2010, using spherical aberration-corrected STEM and
conventional TEM. Although their mineralogy is almost identical to the
equilibrated LL chondrites and therefore basically anhydrous,
micrometer-to-submicrometer-sized sylvite was identified on the surface
of Itokawa particle RA-QD02-0034. Separately, micrometer-sized halite
was also identified on the surface of Itokawa particle RA-QD02-0129.
Detailed inspection of the sample processing procedures at the JAXA's
Planetary Materials Sample Curation Facility and textural observation of
the sylvite and halite indicate that they were clearly present on two
Itokawa particles before they were removed from Clean Chamber \#2 at
JAXA. However, there is no direct evidence for their extraterrestrial
origin at present. If the sylvite and halite are extraterrestrial, their
presence suggests that they may be more abundant on the surface of
S-type asteroids than previously thought.

 abstract = "{We developed a novel technique called ''analytical dual-energy
microtomography'' that uses the linear attenuation coefficients (LACs) of
minerals at two different X-ray energies to nondestructively obtain
three-dimensional (3D) images of mineral distribution in materials such
as rock specimens. The two energies are above and below the absorption
edge energy of an abundant element, which we call the ''index element''.
The chemical compositions of minerals forming solid solution series can
also be measured. The optimal size of a sample is of the order of the
inverse of the LAC values at the X-ray energies used. We used
synchrotron-based microtomography with an effective spatial resolution
of {\gt}200 nm to apply this method to small particles (30-180 {$\mu$}m)
collected from the surface of asteroid 25143 Itokawa by the Hayabusa
mission of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). A 3D
distribution of the minerals was successively obtained by imaging the
samples at X-ray energies of 7 and 8 keV, using Fe as the index element
(the K-absorption edge of Fe is 7.11 keV). The optimal sample size in
this case is of the order of 50 {$\mu$}m. The chemical compositions of the
minerals, including the Fe/Mg ratios of ferromagnesian minerals and the
Na/Ca ratios of plagioclase, were measured. This new method is
potentially applicable to other small samples such as cosmic dust, lunar
regolith, cometary dust (recovered by the Stardust mission of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NASA]), and samples from
extraterrestrial bodies (those from future sample return missions such
as the JAXA Hayabusa2 mission and the NASA OSIRIS-REx mission), although
limitations exist for unequilibrated samples. Further, this technique is
generally suited for studying materials in multicomponent systems with
multiple phases across several research fields.

from that reported by Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), placing it near
the intersection between the plate boundary and the Moho of the

trenchward side of the mainshock hypocenter, where the Pacific slab
contacts the island arc crust. The foreshocks were initially activated
at the up-dip limit of the seismogenic zone {\tilde}30 km trenchward of
the largest foreshock (M 7.3, two days before the mainshock). After the
M-7.3 earthquake, intense interplate seismicity, accompanied by
epicenters migrating toward the mainshock hypocenter, was observed. The
focal depth distribution changed significantly in response to the M-9
mainshock. Earthquakes along the plate boundary were almost non-existent

increased in numbers in both the upper and the lower plates.

 abstract = "{{\lt}title type=''main''{\gt}SUMMARYThe GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate
Experiment) satellite mission provides global time-series of the Earth's
gravity field. In view of limited resolution and noise from the GRACE
data, various filtering techniques have been developed to extract an
optimal signal. There is no conclusion on the best filter method so far,
however. On the other hand, terrestrial gravity observations from
superconducting gravimeters (SGs) provide variations of the gravity
field with very high accuracy and time resolution, but only at single
points. The aim of this study is to compare GRACE-derived temporal
gravity variations with gravity time-series within a network of six
Central European SG stations. Empirical orthogonal functions (EOF)
analysis was applied to detect common signal characteristics over a 3 yr
period (2004-2006). rms Differences between the time-series of several
GRACE solutions amount to 60 per cent of the rms variability of the
individual data sets. The rms differences between the SG and GRACE
time-series are about 70 per cent of the rms value of the SG
observations. The best agreement between SG and GRACE is obtained when
using a Gaussian filter with filter lengths of 800-1250 km for the GRACE
data. With the EOF analysis, a common regional signal can be deduced
from all gravity data sets. Nevertheless, differences in the first EOF
among the GRACE solutions were up to 40 per cent, and differences of up
to 50 per cent were found between the SG-based terrestrial and the
GRACE-based satellite observations.

examined the occurrence of the LENA cusp signal during positive IMF
B$_{Z}$ in terms of the arrival direction and the IMF clock angle
{\thetas}$_{CA}$. Results of statistical analyses show that the
occurrence frequency is high on the postnoon side when
{\thetas}$_{CA}$ is between {\tilde}20{\deg} and {\tilde}50{\deg}. This
is ascribed to ion injection caused by cusp reconnection typical of
positive IMF B$_{Z}$. Our results also show that there is another
situation of high occurrence frequency, which can be identified with
{\thetas}$_{CA}$ of {\tilde}30{\deg} to {\tilde}80{\deg}. When
{\thetas}$_{CA}$ is relatively large (60{\deg}-80{\deg}), occurrence
frequencies are high at relatively low latitudes over a wide extent
spanning both prenoon and postnoon sectors. This feature suggests that
the ion injection is caused by reconnection at the dayside magnetopause.
Its postnoon side boundary shifts toward the prenoon as
{\thetas}$_{CA}$ decreases. When {\thetas}$_{CA}$ is less than
{\tilde}50{\deg}, the high occurrence frequency exists well inside the
prenoon sector, which is azimuthally separated from the postnoon region
ascribed to cusp reconnection. The prenoon region, which is thought due
to ion injection caused by dayside reconnection, may explain the recent
report that proton aurora brightening occurs in the unanticipated
prenoon sector of the northern high-latitude ionosphere for IMF
B$_{Y}$ {\gt} 0 and B$_{Z}$ {\gt} 0.

Sulfur-bearing Fe-rich nanoparticles exist in a thin (5 to 15

which is suggestive of vapor deposition. Sulfur-free Fe-rich
nanoparticles exist deeper inside ({\lt}60 nanometers) ferromagnesian

rendezvous target for interplanetary missions because of its
easy-to-reach orbit. The physical and thermal properties of the asteroid
are relevant for establishing the scientific mission goals and also
important in the context of near-Earth object studies in general. <BR />
Aims: Our goal was to derive key physical parameters such as shape,
spin-vector, size, geometric albedo, and surface properties of 162173
(1999 JU3). <BR /> Methods: With three sets of published thermal
observations (ground-based N-band, Akari IRC, Spitzer IRS), we applied a
thermophysical model to derive the radiometric properties of the
asteroid. The calculations were performed for the full range of possible
shape and spin-vector solutions derived from the available sample of
visual lightcurve observations. <BR /> Results: The near-Earth asteroid
162173 (1999 JU3) has an effective diameter of 0.87 {\plusmn} 0.03 km and
a geometric albedo of 0.070 {\plusmn} 0.006. The {$\chi$}$^{2}$-test
reveals a strong preference for a retrograde sense of rotation with a
spin-axis orientation of {$\lambda$}$_{ecl}$ = 73{\deg},
{$\beta$}$_{ecl}$ = -62{\deg} and P$_{sid}$ = 7.63 {\plusmn} 0.01
h. The most likely thermal inertia ranges between 200 and 600 J
m$^{-2}$ s$^{-0.5}$ K$^{-1}$, about a factor of 2
lower than the value for 25143 Itokawa. This indicates that the surface
lies somewhere between a thick-dust regolith and a
rock/boulder/cm-sized, gravel-dominated surface like that of 25143
Itokawa. Our analysis represents the first time that shape and
spin-vector information has been derived from a combined data set of
visual lightcurves (reflected light) and mid-infrared photometry and
spectroscopy (thermal emission).

The asteroid's orthogonal axes are 535, 294, and 209 meters, the mass is
3.43 {\times} 10$^{10}$ kilograms, and the estimated bulk density
is 1.9 +/- 0.13 grams per cubic centimeter. The correspondence between
the smooth areas on the surface (Muses Sea and Sagamihara) and the
gravitationally low regions suggests mass movement and an effective
resurfacing process by impact jolting. Itokawa is considered to be a
rubble-pile body because of its low bulk density, high porosity,
boulder-rich appearance, and shape. The existence of very large boulders
and pillars suggests an early collisional breakup of a preexisting
parent asteroid followed by a re-agglomeration into a rubble-pile
object.

derive a radiometric effective diameter of 0.32 {\plusmn} 0.03 km and an

model. This effective diameter corresponds to a slightly asymmetrical

Kaasalainen et al. (2005, Proceedings of the 1st Hayabusa Symposium, ASP

observations lead to size estimates which are about 15\% smaller than the
radar results (Ostro et al. 2005, Met. Plan. Sci., submitted), slightly
outside the stated radar uncertainties of {\plusmn}10\%. We determined a
rather high thermal inertia of 750 J m$^{-2}$ s$^{-0.5}$
K$^{-1}$. This is an indication for a bare rock dominated surface,
a thick dust regolith can be excluded as well as a metallic surface.
From our data we constructed a 10.0 {$\mu$}m thermal lightcurve which is
nicely matched in amplitude and phase by the shape and spin vector
solution in combination with our TPM description. The assumed S-type
bulk density in combination with radiometric size lead to a total mass
estimate of 4.5$^{+2.0}$$_{-1.8}$ {\times} 10$^{10}$

properties of the surface of Itokawa were characterized by analyzing its
photometric properties and behavior. Results included here capitalize on
analysis of broadband photometric observations taken with a number of
telescopes, instruments, and observers. We employed a Hapke model to
estimate the surface roughness, single particle scattering albedo,
single particle scattering characteristics, phase integral, and
geometric and bond albedo. We find that this asteroid has a higher
geometric albedo than average main belt S-class asteroids; this is
consistent with results from other observers. The broadband colors of
Itokawa further support evidence that this is an atypical S-class
asteroid. Broadband colors show spectral characteristics more typically
found on large-diameter main-belt asteroids believed to be
space-weathered, suggesting the surface of this small diameter,
near-Earth asteroid could likewise be space-weathered.
