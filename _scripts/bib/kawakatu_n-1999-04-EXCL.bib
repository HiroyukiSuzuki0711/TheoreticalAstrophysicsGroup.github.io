 abstract = "{We propose a new evolutionary model of a supermassive black hole (SMBH)
and a circumnuclear disk (CND), taking into account the mass-supply from
a host galaxy and the physical states of CND. In the model, two distinct
accretion modes depending on gravitational stability of the CND play a
key role on accreting gas  to a SMBH. (i) If the CND is gravitationally
unstable, energy feedback from supernovae (SNe) supports a geometrically
thick, turbulent gas disk. The accretion in this mode is dominated by
turbulent viscosity, and it is significantly larger than that in the
mode (ii), i.e.,  the CND is supported by gas pressure. Once the gas
supply from the host is stopped, the high accretion phase changes to the
low one  (mode (ii)), but there is a delay with {\tilde} 10$^{8}$
yr. Through this evolution, the gas-rich CND turns into the gas poor
stellar disk.  We found that not all the gas supplied from the host
galaxy to the central 100 pc region accrete onto the SMBH even in the
high accretion phase (mode (i)), because  the part of gas is used to
form stars. Moreover, a super-Eddington accretion is possible in the
high accretion phase and thus the its condition is briefly discussed.

how compact symmetric objects (CSOs) evolve into Fanaroff-Riley type II

growth of radio lobes, we predict that the advance speed of hot spots
and lobes inevitably show a deceleration phase (CSO-MSO phase) and an
acceleration phase (MSO-FRII phase). This is ascribed to the sharp
change of ambient matter density in the MSO phase ({\tilde} 1 kpc). Based
on our findings, we finally discuss the fate of CSOs.

total pressure (Pc) and electron temperature (Te) of the cocoon. The
number density of the total electrons (ne$^{-}$) is constrained by
using the non-thermal spectrum of the hot spot and the analysis of the
momentum balance between the jet thrust and the rum pressure of ICM.
Together with the obtained Pc, Te and ne$^{-}$, we constrain the
matter content in the jets. We find that, in the case of Cygnus A, the
ratio of number density of protons to that of electrons is of order of
10$^{-3}$ . This implies the existence of a large number of
positron in the jet.

present scenario, the AGN luminosity-dominant phase (QSO phase) is
preceded by the host luminosity-dominat phase, which is called

within younger bulges. Also, the proto-QSO phase is anticipated by an
optically-thick ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) phase.
Furthermore, such radiation hydrodynamic model has been also applied to
disk galaxies. It turns out that the mass of a SMBH primarily correlates
with a bulge component even in a disk galaxy. Thus, by analogy to
proto-QSOs, the BH growing phase in disk galaxies may have massive dusty
disks within younger bulges.

overwhelms the BH accretion luminosity in the growing phase of SMBH.
