 abstract = "{High-resolution imaging of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect opens new
possibilities for testing the presence of various high-energy particle
populations in clusters of galaxies. A detailed X-ray analysis of the
'Bullet cluster' (1E 0657-56) with Chandra has revealed the presence of
additional X-ray spectral components beyond a simple, single-temperature
plasma in its X-ray spectra. X-ray methods alone are insufficient to
elucidate the origins of these spectral components. We show that the
morphology and magnitude of the SZ effect at high frequencies are
critically dependent upon the mechanism by which the additional X-ray
spectra are created. We examine the differences between the predicted SZ
effect emission maps at 600 GHz assuming the X-ray spectra are composed
of thermal gas with a steep power-law index component and also thermal
gas with a significant contribution of strongly heated gas. A
two-temperature model with a hot (kT {\sime} 30-40 keV) second component
is the most consistent with existing SZ data at high frequencies.
However, significant morphological differences remain.
High-angular-resolution SZ intensity maps at high frequencies in
combination with deep X-ray data provide a new window into understanding
particle energization processes in the hottest, massive merging galaxy
clusters.

 abstract = "{ORIGIN is a proposal for the M3 mission call of ESA aimed at the study
of metal creation from the epoch of cosmic dawn. Using high-spectral
resolution in the soft X-ray band, ORIGIN will be able to identify the
physical conditions of all abundant elements between C and Ni to
red-shifts of z = 10, and beyond. The mission will answer questions such
as: When were the first metals created? How does the cosmic metal
content evolve? Where do most of the metals reside in the Universe? What
is the role of metals in structure formation and evolution? To reach out
to the early Universe ORIGIN will use Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) to study
their local environments in their host galaxies. This requires the
capability to slew the satellite in less than a minute to the GRB
location. By studying the chemical composition and properties of
clusters of galaxies we can extend the range of exploration to lower
redshifts ( z {\tilde}0.2). For this task we need a high-resolution
spectral imaging instrument with a large field of view. Using the same
instrument, we can also study the so far only partially detected baryons
in the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM). The less dense part of the
WHIM will be studied using absorption lines at low redshift in the
spectra for GRBs. The ORIGIN mission includes a Transient Event Detector
(coded mask with a sensitivity of 0.4 photon/cm$^{2}$/s in 10 s in
the 5-150 keV band) to identify and localize 2000 GRBs over a five year
mission, of which {\tilde}65 GRBs have a redshift {\gt}7. The Cryogenic
Imaging Spectrometer, with a spectral resolution of 2.5 eV, a field of
view of 30 arcmin and large effective area below 1 keV has the
sensitivity to study clusters up to a significant fraction of the virial
radius and to map the denser parts of the WHIM (factor 30 higher than
achievable with current instruments). The payload is complemented by a
Burst InfraRed Telescope to enable onboard red-shift determination of
GRBs (hence securing proper follow up of high-z bursts) and also probes
the mildly ionized state of the gas. Fast repointing is achieved by a
dedicated Controlled Momentum Gyro and a low background is achieved by
the selected low Earth orbit.

We calculate relativistically corrected SZ intensity maps of a

morphologies of the SZ intensity maps are remarkably different between
345 and 857 GHz for each merging cluster. We show that high-resolution

obtainable with the LABOCA and HERSCHEL-SPIRE instruments, allow to
fully exploit the astrophysical relevance of the predicted SZ

which do not assume the spherically symmetric distribution, permit us to

in galaxy clusters by analysing the presence of temperature

effect distortion of the cosmic microwave background provide methods to
derive the gas pressure and temperature of galaxy clusters. Here we
study the ability of SZ effect observations to derive the electron
distribution function (DF) in massive galaxy clusters. <BR /> Methods:
Our calculations of the SZ effect include relativistic corrections
considered within the framework of the Wright formalism and use a
decomposition technique of electron DFs into Fourier series. Using
multi-frequency measurements of the SZ effect, we find the solution of a
linear system of equations that is used to derive the Fourier
coefficients; we further analyze different frequency samples to decrease
uncertainties in Fourier coefficient estimations. <BR /> Results: We
propose a method to derive DFs of electrons using SZ multi-frequency
observations of massive galaxy clusters. We found that the best
frequency sample to derive an electron DF includes high frequencies {$\nu$}
= 375, 600, 700, 857 GHz. We show that it is possible to distinguish a
Juttner DF from a Maxwell-Bolzman DF as well as from a Juttner DF with
the second electron population by means of SZ observations for the best
frequency sample if the precision of SZ intensity measurements is less

 abstract = "{How structures of various scales formed and evolved from the early
Universe up to present time is a fundamental question of astrophysical
cosmology. EDGE (Piro et al., 2007) will trace the cosmic history of the
baryons from the early generations of massive stars by Gamma-Ray Burst
(GRB) explosions, through the period of galaxy cluster formation, down
to the very low redshift Universe, when between a third and one half of
the baryons are expected to reside in cosmic filaments undergoing
gravitational collapse by dark matter (the so-called warm hot
intragalactic medium). In addition EDGE, with its unprecedented
capabilities, will provide key results in many important fields. These
scientific goals are feasible with a medium class mission using existing
technology combined with innovative instrumental and observational
capabilities by: (a) observing with fast reaction Gamma-Ray Bursts with
a high spectral resolution. This enables the study of their star-forming
and host galaxy environments and the use of GRBs as back lights of large
scale cosmological structures; (b) observing and surveying extended
sources (galaxy clusters, WHIM) with high sensitivity using two wide
field of view X-ray telescopes (one with a high angular resolution and
the other with a high spectral resolution). The mission concept includes
four main instruments: a Wide-field Spectrometer (0.1-2.2 eV) with
excellent energy resolution (3 eV at 0.6 keV), a Wide-Field Imager
(0.3-6 keV) with high angular resolution (HPD = 15{\rdquo}) constant over
the full 1.4 degree field of view, and a Wide Field Monitor (8-200 keV)
with a FOV of {\frac14} of the sky, which will trigger the fast
repointing to the GRB. Extension of its energy response up to 1 MeV will
be achieved with a GRB detector with no imaging capability. This mission
is proposed to ESA as part of the Cosmic Vision call. We will outline
the science drivers and describe in more detail the payload of this
mission.

observations (149 ks and 122 ks for XIS and HXD, respectively) of the
most X-ray luminous galaxy cluster, RX J1347.5-1145, at z=0.451.  <BR
/>Aims: To understand the gas physics of a violent, cluster merger, we
study physical properties of the hot ( 20 keV) gas clump in the
south-east (SE) region discovered previously by Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ)
effect observations. Using hard X-ray data, a signature of non-thermal
emission is also explored.  <BR />Methods: We perform single as well as
multi-temperature fits to the Suzaku XIS spectra. The Suzaku XIS and
HXD, and the Chandra ACIS-I data are then combined to examine the
properties of the hot gas component in the SE region. We finally look
for non-thermal emission in the Suzaku HXD data.  <BR />Results: The
single-temperature model fails to reproduce the 0.5-10 keV continuum
emission and Fe-K lines measured by XIS simultaneously. A
two-temperature model with a very hot component improves the fit,
although the XIS data can only provide a lower limit to the temperature
of the hot component. In the Suzaku HXD data, we detect hard X-ray
emission above the background in the 12-40 keV band at the 9{$\sigma$}
level; however, the significance becomes marginal when the systematic
error in the background estimation is included. With the joint analysis
of the Suzaku and Chandra data, we determine the temperature of the hot
gas in the SE region to be 25.3$^{+6.1}$$_{-4.5}$
(statistical; 90\% confidence level) $^{+6.9}$$_{-9.5}$
(systematic; 90\% confidence level) keV, which is in an excellent
agreement with the previous joint analysis of the SZ effect in radio and
the Chandra X-ray data. This is the first time that the X-ray analysis
alone provides a good measurement of the hot component temperature in
the SE region, which is possible because of Suzaku's unprecedented
sensitivity over the wide X-ray band. These results indicate strongly
that RX J1347.5-1145 has undergone a recent, violent merger. The
spectral analysis shows that the SE component is consistent with being
thermal. We measure the 3{$\sigma$} upper limit to the non-thermal flux,
F{\lt}8{\times}10$^{-12}$ erg s$^{-1 cm^{-2}$$\}$ in the 12-60
keV band, which provides a limit on the inverse Compton scattering of
relativistic electrons off the CMB photons. Combining this limit with
the discovery of a radio mini halo in this cluster at 1.4 GHz, which
measures the synchrotron radiation, we find a lower limit to the
strength of the intracluster magnetic field, such that B{\gt}0.007 $\{${$\mu$}

 abstract = "{Water ices exist mostly in a variety of forms of mixtures with silicate
or some other components (e.g., ammonia) in the solar system. Thus, it
is of importance to understand the impact process on ice silicate
mixtures. We performed impact experiments on ice silicate mixture target
using a gas gun and a two-stage light-gas gun in a cold room at 263 K in
the Institute of Low Temperature, Hokkaido University. Silicate content
of the target was varied from 0 to 50 wt\%. Targets were 10 or 30 cm in
diameter, and 5 cm in height. Projectile velocity was varied between 299
and 657 m/s and projectile mass was 1.6 g for the gas gun shot, and 1480
and 3684 m/s and 7 mg for the two-stage light-gas gun. Crater morphology
changes with silicate content and impact velocity: craters formed on
targets of 50 wt\% silicate content had less spallation than those with
the other silicate content and crater profiles at higher impact velocity
became sharper than those at lower impact velocity. Although
diameter-to-depth ratio is not dependent on silicate content of the
target, this ratio became large at low peak pressure for the gas gun
shots. This is probably because of accretion of pure ice projectile onto
the target surface. The decrease of crater volume with increasing
silicate content was visible for the results from the two-stage
light-gas gun. We estimated the target tensile strength based on a
hydrodynamic ejection model of [Melosh, H.J. Impact ejection,
spallation, and the origin of meteorites. Icarus, 59, 234 260, 1984].
The ejection model predicts a relation between target tensile strength,
spall fragment thickness and ejection point. If a constant shock
attenuation rate is assumed for all the ice silicate mixture targets,
the tensile strength derived for the mixture with 50 wt\% rock content

 abstract = "{Six different geophysical investigations, (1) ground-penetrating radar,
(2) DC resistivity sounding, (3) seismic refraction, (4) very low
frequency (VHF) electromagnetic, (5) helicopter borne electromagnetic
(HEM), and (6) transient electromagnetic (TEM) techniques, were employed
to obtain information on the ice body properties of pingos near
Fairbanks, Alaska. The surface nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data
were also compared from similar sites near one of the study pingos. The
geophysical investigations were undertaken, along with core sampling and
permafrost drilling, to enable measurement of the ground temperature
regime. Drilling (ground truthing) results support field geophysical
investigations, and have led to the development of a technique for
distinguishing massive ice and overburden material of the permafrost.
The two-dimensional DC resistivity sounding tomography and
ground-penetrating radar profiling are useful for ice detection under
heterogeneous conditions. However, the DC resistivity sounding
investigation required high-quality ground contact and less area
coverage. The active layer thickness and the homogeneous horizontal
structure of the overburden material are important parameters
influencing detection of massive ice in permafrost for most methods such
as seismic, TEM, or surface NMR.

 abstract = "{It has been suggested that methane clathrate is stable in the subsurface
of Mars (Max and Clifford, (J. Geophys. Res.-Planets 105 (E2) (2000)
4165). Max and Clifford (Geophys. Res. Lett. 28(9) (2001) 1787) have
proposed that the Martian chaotic terrain could be a surface
manifestation of the dissociation of subsurface methane clathrate
hydrate. They have used the large terrestrial sub-oceanic landforms
(which have formed due to dissociation of methane clathrate) as an
analog. The detection of methane (either in the form of gas or in the
solid form of clathrate hydrate) would be evidence of indigenous life in
the Martian subsurface, since methane on Earth has mostly biogenic
origin. Moreover, methane is a valuable resource for the human
exploration of Mars. We propose a novel approach to search for potential
Martian methane clathrate hydrate and perform related computations. Our
method uses the effect of latent heat of clathrate-phase transitions on
the internal heat flow, and hence on permafrost thickness above the
clathrate deposit. It will allow one to extract related information out
of the radar data that will be used to search for the ground ice/ground
water interface. The interpretation of the radar data of ground
ice/ground water boundary, which we propose here, can be used to analyze
the SHARAD radar data set (Seu et al., 2003) on the Mars Reconnaissance
Orbiter (MRO) 2005 mission and the potential Ground Penetrating Radar
data on the Mars Science Laboratory, currently planned to be launched in
2009. From this viewpoint we make recommendations for future
orbiting/landed missions to Mars.

    month = apr,
   volume = 55,
    pages = {159-172},
 abstract = "{In the 1940's, several destructive earthquakes occurred in western
Japan. Seismograms in this period were usually recorded on smoked paper
and the quality was poor compared to modern digital data. But the recent
development of image processing technology enabled us to reconstruct
feasible waveform data, whereby we investigated source rupture processes
of two devastating earthquakes: the Tonankai earthquake (M7.9) of
December 7, 1944, and the Mikawa earthquake (M6.8) of January 13, 1945.
The results for the Tonankai earthquake show that the source roughly
consists of a single asperity with a length scale of 100 km, having no
segment structure with a smaller length-scale. Such a feature seems to
be reflected to the sea bottom topography above the source region. The
main source parameters are as follows: the seismic moment = 1.0 {\times}
10$^{21}$ Nm (Mw=7.9); the fault area = 140 km {\times} 80 km;
(strike, dip, rake) = (225{\deg}, 15{\deg}, 79{\deg}); the maximum and
averaged dislocations = 4.4 m and 3.0 m, respectively. The analysis of
the seismograms for the Mikawa earthquake shows that the source is a
reverse fault with a slight left-lateral component. The pressure axis is
directed to ENE-WSW, which is a little rotated from the EW compression
axis prevailing in western Japan. This fault can be regarded as the
southern extension of the Nobi earthquake fault system. The main source
parameters are as follows: the seismic moment = 1.0 {\times}
10$^{19}$ Nm (Mw=6.6); the fault area = 20 km {\times} 15 km;
(strike, dip, rake) = (135{\deg}, 30{\deg}, 65{\deg}); the maximum and
averaged dislocations are 2.1 m and 1.1 m, respectively. The slip
distribution mainly consists of two asperities: the one near the
hypocenter and the other 10-15 km northwest from it. The heavily damaged
area is well correlated with the northwestern asperity.
