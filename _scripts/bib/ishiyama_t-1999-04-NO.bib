 abstract = "{Land cover change of the oases surrounding Taklimakan Desert in Xinjiang
Uyghur in the past 40 years was examined by means of satellite images.
From the results of the analysis of these images, the following have
been explained. The farmland utilization ratio in average stands at 0.28
in the northern edge of Taklimakan Desert. In the meantime, the ratio
stands at 0.13 in the southern edge, whereas 0.31 in the western edge.
It is revealed that in the northern edge, area of the irrigation land is
vast enough to be utilized. Small oases are much noticed generally in
the southern edge, and accounted for usually less than 0.15 resulting in
lowness in the utilization ratio of the farmland. However the smaller
the value of the said ratio is, the higher the potential of the farmland
development is. It is explained that the vegetation land is slightly
expanded in the upper reaches of the river in the small oases in the
northern edge, but the vegetation land is drastically changed to barren
land in the lower reaches of the river. On the other hand, it is
explained that the vegetation regions are being expanded year by year in
the oases in the northern edge. Especially in Aksu, the farmland area
was expanded accompanied with increase of the number of the development
settlers.

 abstract = "{The correlation between vegetation index and physical parameters of
vegetation was analyzed in order to monitor vegetation in an arid area
based on satellite data. Results indicate that the vegetation index is
highly correlated with physical parameters of vegetation, in particular,
dry biomass and leaf area index (LAI). However the correlation
coefficient between vegetation index and vegetation coverage is slightly
low. Results of vegetation monitoring based on satellite data which are
analyzed by an algorithm we developed can be utilized to study
desertification and the vegetation environment.
