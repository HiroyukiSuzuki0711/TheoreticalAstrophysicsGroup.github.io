 abstract = "{We perform N-body simulations on a multiple massive black hole (MBH)
system in a host galaxy to derive the criteria for successive MBH
merger. The calculations incorporate the dynamical friction by stars and
general relativistic effects as pericentre shift and gravitational wave
recoil. The orbits of MBHs are pursed down to 10 Schwarzschild radii
({\tilde}1 au). As a result, it is shown that about a half of MBHs merge
during 1 Gyr in a galaxy with mass 10$^{11}$ M$_{&sun;}$ and
stellar velocity dispersion 240 km s$^{-1}$, even if the recoil
velocity is two times as high as the stellar velocity dispersion. The
dynamical friction allows a binary MBH to interact frequently with other
MBHs, and then the decay of the binary orbits leads to the merger
through gravitational wave radiation, as shown by Tanikawa {\amp}
Umemura. We derive the MBH merger criteria for the masses, sizes, and
luminosities of host galaxies. It is found that the successive MBH
mergers are expected in bright galaxies, depending on redshifts.
Furthermore, we find that the central stellar density is reduced by the
sling-shot mechanism and that high-velocity stars with {\tilde}1000 km
s$^{-1}$ are generated intermittently in extremely radial orbits.

 abstract = "{We show, using global three-dimensional grid-based hydrodynamical
simulations, that ultrafast outflows (UFOs) from active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) result in considerable feedback of energy and momentum into the
interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy. The AGN wind interacts
strongly with the inhomogeneous, two-phase ISM consisting of dense
clouds embedded in a tenuous, hot, hydrostatic medium. The outflow
floods through the intercloud channels, sweeps up the hot ISM, and
ablates and disperses the dense clouds. The momentum of the UFO is
primarily transferred to the dense clouds via the ram pressure in the
channel flow, and the wind-blown bubble evolves in the energy-driven
regime. Any dependence on UFO opening angle disappears after the first
interaction with obstructing clouds. On kpc scales, therefore, feedback
by UFOs operates similarly to feedback by relativistic AGN jets.
Negative feedback is significantly stronger if clouds are distributed
spherically rather than in a disk. In the latter case, the turbulent
backflow of the wind drives mass inflow toward the central black hole.
Considering the common occurrence of UFOs in AGNs, they are likely to be
important in the cosmological feedback cycles of galaxy formation.

relativistic active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets interacting with a
two-phase fractal interstellar medium (ISM) in the kpc-scale core of
galaxies using 29 three-dimensional grid-based hydrodynamical
simulations. The feedback efficiency, as measured by the amount of cloud
dispersal generated by the jet-ISM interactions, is sensitive to the
maximum size of clouds in the fractal cloud distribution but not to
their volume filling factor. Feedback ceases to be efficient for
Eddington ratios P $_{jet}$/L $_{edd}$ {\lt}\~{}
10$^{-4}$, although systems with large cloud complexes {\gt}\~{} 50 pc
require jets of Eddington ratio in excess of 10$^{-2}$ to disperse
the clouds appreciably. Based on measurements of the bubble expansion
rates in our simulations, we argue that sub-grid AGN prescriptions
resulting in negative feedback in cosmological simulations without a
multi-phase treatment of the ISM are good approximations if the volume
filling factor of warm-phase material is less than 0.1 and the cloud
complexes are smaller than \~{}25 pc. We find that the acceleration of the
dense embedded clouds is provided by the ram pressure of the
high-velocity flow through the porous channels of the warm phase, flow
that has fully entrained the shocked hot-phase gas it has swept up, and
is additionally mass loaded by ablated cloud material. This mechanism
transfers 10\% to 40\% of the jet energy to the cold and warm gas,
accelerating it within a few 10 to 100 Myr to velocities that match
those observed in a range of high- and low-redshift radio galaxies
hosting powerful radio jets.

surface brightness profiles of Ly{$\alpha$} haloes around high-z galaxies

of the Ly{$\alpha$} radial profiles become flatter as the Mpc-scale LAE
surface density increases, but that they are almost independent of the
central UV luminosity. The characteristic exponential scalelength of the
Ly{$\alpha$} haloes appears to be proportional to the square of the LAE
surface density (r Ly {$\alpha$}{\prop}{$\Sigma$} LAE 2). Including the
diffuse, extended Ly{$\alpha$} haloes, the rest-frame Ly{$\alpha$} equivalent
width of the LAEs in the densest regions approaches EW$_{0}$
{\tilde} 200 {\AA}, the maximum value expected for young
({\lt}10$^{7}$ yr) galaxies. This suggests that Ly{$\alpha$} photons
formed via shock compression by gas outflows or cooling radiation by
gravitational gas inflows may partly contribute to the illumination of
Ly{$\alpha$} haloes; however, most of their Ly{$\alpha$} luminosity can be
explained by photoionization by or by scattering of Ly{$\alpha$} photons
produced from H II regions in and around the central galaxies.
Regardless of the source of Ly{$\alpha$} photons, if the Ly{$\alpha$} haloes
trace the overall gaseous structure, following the dark matter
distribution, it is not surprising that the Ly{$\alpha$} spatial extent
depends more strongly on the surrounding Mpc-scale environment than on
the activity of the central galaxies.

components with different velocities but parts of a single line that are
modified by the absorption and/or scattering by the associated neutral
hydrogen gas. The characteristic profile can be naturally explained by
scattering in the expanding shell of the neutral hydrogen surrounding
the Ly{$\alpha$} emitting region while the attenuation by the intergalactic
medium should also be considered. Our results suggest that the star
formation in these Ly{$\alpha$} emitters are dominated by young burst-like
events that produce the intrinsic Ly{$\alpha$} emission as well as the gas

high-density region at z = 3.09, whose peak local density is six times

robust ''protocluster.'' We also compared the overdensity of the 100

protocluster with the expected fluctuation of the dark matter as well as
those of the model galaxies in cosmological simulations. We found that
the peak height values of the overdensity are 8-10 and 3-4 times the
expected standard deviations for the counts of Ly{$\alpha$} emitters at z =

fourth-order Hermite scheme, where not only three-body interaction of
MBHs but also dynamical friction by stars are incorporated. Initially,
10 MBHs with equal masses of 10$^{7}$ M $_{sun}$ are set in
a host galaxy with 10$^{11}$ M $_{sun}$. It is found that
4-6 MBHs merge successively within 1 Gyr, emitting gravitational wave
radiation. The key process for the successive merger of MBHs is the
dynamical friction by field stars, which enhances three-body
interactions of MBHs when they enter the central regions of the galaxy.
The heaviest MBH always composes a close binary at the galactic center,
which shrinks owing to the angular momentum transfer by the third MBH
and eventually merges. The angular momentum transfer by the third MBH is
due to the sling-shot mechanism. We find that the secular Kozai
mechanism does not work for a binary to merge if we include the
relativistic pericenter shift. The simulations show that a multiple MBH
system can produce a heavier MBH at the galactic center purely through
N-body process. This merger path can be of great significance for the
growth of MBHs in a primordial galaxy. The merger of multiple MBHs may
be a potential source of gravitational waves for the Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna and pulsar timing.

 abstract = "{We present a novel radiation hydrodynamics code, START, which is a
smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme coupled with accelerated
radiative transfer. The basic idea for the acceleration of radiative
transfer is parallel to the tree algorithm that is hitherto used to
speed up the gravitational force calculation in an N-body system. It is
demonstrated that the radiative transfer calculations can be
dramatically accelerated, where the computational time is scaled as
N$_{p}$ logN$_{s}$ for N$_{p}$ SPH particles and
N$_{s}$ radiation sources. Such acceleration allows us to readily
include not only numerous sources but also scattering photons, even if
the total number of radiation sources is comparable to that of SPH
particles. Here, a test simulation is presented for a multiple source
problem, where the results with START are compared to those with a
radiation SPH code without tree-based acceleration. We find that the
results agree well with each other if we set the tolerance parameter as
{\thetas}$_{crit}$ {\lt}= 1.0, and then it demonstrates that START
can solve radiative transfer faster without reducing the accuracy. One
of the important applications with START is to solve the transfer of
diffuse ionizing photons, where each SPH particle is regarded as an
emitter. To illustrate the competence of START, we simulate the
shadowing effect by dense clumps around an ionizing source. As a result,
it is found that the erosion of shadows by diffuse recombination photons
can be solved. Such an effect is of great significance to reveal the
cosmic reionization process.

attention is paid to the dependence of radiative feedback on the mass of
source Pop III star. UV radiation from the source star can work to
impede the secondary star formation through the photoheating and
photodissociation processes. Recently, Susa and Umemura have shown that
the ionizing radiation alleviates the negative effect by
H$_{2}$-dissociating radiation from 120M$_{solar}$ Pop III
star, since an H$_{2}$ shell formed ahead of an ionizing front can
effectively shield H$_{2}$-dissociating radiation. On the other
hand, it is expected that the negative feedback by
H$_{2}$-dissociating radiation can be predominant if a source star
is less massive, since a ratio of the H$_{2}$-dissociating photon
number to the ionizing photon number becomes higher. In order to
investigate the radiative feedback effects from such less massive stars,
we perform three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations,
incorporating the radiative transfer effect of ionizing and
H$_{2}$-dissociating radiation. As a result, we find that if a
source star is less massive than \~{}25M$_{solar}$, the ionizing
radiation cannot suppress the negative feedback of
H$_{2}$-dissociating radiation. Therefore, the fate of the
neighbouring clouds around such less massive stars is determined solely
by the flux of H$_{2}$-dissociating radiation from source stars.
By making analytic estimates of H$_{2}$ shell formation and its
shielding effect, we derive the criteria for radiation hydrodynamic
feedback depending on the source star mass.

lensing by Population III stars in the light curves of gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs). Significant portions of GRBs can originate in hypernovae of
Population III stars and be gravitationally lensed by foreground
Population III stars or their remnants. If the lens mass is on the order
of 10$^{2}$-10$^{3}$ M$_{solar}$ and the lens redshift
is greater than 10, the time delay between two lensed images of a GRB is
\~{}1 s and the image separation is \~{}10 {$\mu$}as. Although it is difficult to
resolve the two lensed images spatially with current facilities, the
light curves of the two images are superimposed with a delay of \~{}1 s.
GRB light curves usually exhibit noticeable variability, where each
spike is less than 1 s. If a GRB is lensed, all spikes are superimposed
with the same time delay. Hence, if the autocorrelation of the light
curve with changing time interval is calculated, it should show
resonance at the time delay of the lensed images. Applying this
autocorrelation method to GRB light curves that are archived as the
BATSE catalog, we demonstrate that more than half of the light curves
show recognizable resonance they are lensed. Furthermore, in 1821 GRBs
we actually find one candidate for a GRB lensed by a Population III
star, which may be located at redshift 20-200. The present method is
quite straightforward and therefore provides an effective tool for
searching for Population III stars at redshift greater than 10. Using
this method, we may find more candidates for GRBs lensed by Population
III stars in the data of the Swift satellite.

 abstract = "{Based on the gamma-ray burst event rate at redshifts of 4{\lt}=z{\lt}=12,
which is assessed by the spectral peak energy-to-luminosity relation
recently found by Yonetoku et al., we observationally derive the star
formation rate (SFR) for Population III (Pop. III) stars in a
high-redshift universe. As a result, we find that Pop. III stars could
form continuously at 4{\lt}=z{\lt}=12. Using the derived Pop. III SFR, we
attempt to estimate the ultraviolet (UV) photon emission rate at
7{\lt}=z{\lt}=12 in which redshift range no observational information has
been hitherto obtained on ionizing radiation intensity. We find that the
UV emissivity at 7{\lt}=z{\lt}=12 can make a noticeable contribution to
the early reionization. The maximal emissivity is higher than the level
required to keep ionizing the intergalactic matter (IGM) at
7{\lt}=z{\lt}=12. However, if the escape fraction of ionizing photons from
Pop. III objects is smaller than 10\%, then the IGM can be neutralized at
some redshift, which may lead to the double reionization. As for the
enrichment, the ejection of all metals synthesized in Pop. III objects
is marginally consistent with the IGM metallicity, although the
confinement of metals in Pop. III objects can reduce the enrichment
significantly.

Subaru Deep Field. This object is selected as a candidate of an
i$^{'}$-dropout high-redshift galaxy around z=6 because of its red
i$^{'}$-z$^{'}$ color in our deep optical imaging survey in
the Subaru Deep Field. Our follow-up optical spectroscopy reveals that
this object is a strong Ly{$\alpha$} emitter with only very faint
ultraviolet continuum. The rest-frame equivalent width of the detected
Ly{$\alpha$} emission is as much as 130 {\AA}. Thus the light detected in
our z$^{'}$ image is largely attributed to the Ly{$\alpha$} emission,
i.e., \~{}40\% of the z$^{'}$-band flux is the strong Ly{$\alpha$}
emission, giving a very red i$^{'}$-z$^{'}$ color. This is
consistent with the photometric property of this object because the
narrowband data obtained with the NB921 filter show a significant
depression, z$^{'}$-NB921=-0.54 mag. By using the photometric
data, we show that some other objects among the 48 i$^{'}$-dropout
high-redshift galaxy candidates found in the Subaru Deep Field also show
a significant NB921 depression. We briefly discuss the nature of these
NB921-depressed objects.

the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.

basically determined by the nuclear energy conversion efficiency from

addressed in relation to the BH formation in globular clusters.
Futhermore, a new picture for QSO formation is proposed based on the
present SMBH formation scenario. It is predicted that a host
luminosity-dominant ``proto-QSO phase'' exists before the QSO phase, and
the proto-QSO phase is preceded by an optically-thick ultraluminous

III objects exposed to the external ultraviolet background (UVB)
radiation. Assuming spherical symmetry, we solve self-consistently
radiative transfer of photons, non-equilibrium H$_{2}$ chemistry
and gas hydrodynamics. Although the UVB does suppress the formation of
low-mass objects, the negative feedback turns out to be weaker than
previously suggested. In particular, the cut-off scale of collapse drops
significantly below the virial temperature
T$_{vir}$\~{}10$^{4}$K at weak UV intensities
(J$_{21}${\lt}\~{}10$^{-2}$), owing to both self-shielding of
the gas and H$_{2}$ cooling. Clouds above this cut-off tend to
contract highly dynamically, further promoting self-shielding and
H$_{2}$ formation. For plausible radiation intensities and
spectra, the collapsing gas can cool efficiently to temperatures well
below 10$^{4}$K before rotationally supported and the final
H$_{2}$ fraction reaches \~{}10$^{-3}$.

Our results imply that star formation can take place in low-mass objects
collapsing in the UVB. The threshold baryon mass for star formation is
\~{}10$^{9}$M$_{solar}$ for clouds collapsing at redshifts
z{\lt}\~{}3, but drops significantly at higher redshifts. In a conventional
cold dark matter universe, the latter coincides roughly with that of the
1{$\sigma$} density fluctuations. Objects near and above this threshold can
thus constitute `building blocks' of luminous structures, and we discuss
their links to dwarf spheroidal/elliptical galaxies and faint blue
objects. These results suggest that the UVB can play a key role in
regulating the star formation history of the Universe.

shown that the radiation force by the circumnuclear starburst does play
an important role to build up a radiatively-supported dusty wall of la

self-shielded against ionizing photons by radiative transfer effects
