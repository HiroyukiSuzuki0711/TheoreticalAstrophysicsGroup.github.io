 abstract = "{We explore non-thermal emission from a shocked interstellar medium,
which is identified as an expanding shell, driven by a relativistic jet
in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In this work, we particularly focus on
parsec-scale size mini shells surrounding mini radio lobes. From the
radio to X-ray band, the mini radio lobe emission dominates the faint
emission from the mini shell. On the other hand, we find that
inverse-Compton (IC) emission from the shell can overwhelm the
associated lobe emission at the very high energy (VHE; E {\gt} 100 GeV)
{$\gamma$}-ray range, because energy densities of synchrotron photons from
the lobe and/or soft photons from the AGN nucleus are large and IC
scattering works effectively. The predicted IC emission from nearby mini
shells can be detected with the Cherenkov Telescope Array and they are
potentially a new class of VHE {$\gamma$}-ray emitters.

lower than that in broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with a
statistical significance. We found both core-dominated (blazar-like) and
lobe-dominated (radio-galaxy-like) radio structures in these six NLS1s,
which can be understood in the framework of the unified scheme of
radio-loud AGNs that considers radio galaxies as non-beamed parent
populations of blazars. Five of the six NLS1s have (1) extended radio
luminosities suggesting jet kinetic powers of {\gt}\~{} 10$^{44}$ erg
s$^{-1}$, which is sufficient to make jets escape from
hosts' dense environments; (2) black holes of {\gt}\~{} 10$^{7}$ M
$_{&sun;}$, which can generate the necessary jet powers from
near-Eddington mass accretion; and (3) two-sided radio structures at kpc
scales, requiring expansion rates of \~{}0.01c-0.3c and kinematic ages of
{\gt}\~{} 10$^{7}$ years. On the other hand, most typical NLS1s would
be driven by black holes of {\lt}\~{} 10$^{7}$ M $_{&sun;}$ in
a limited lifetime of \~{}10$^{7}$ years. Hence, the kpc-scale radio
structures may originate in a small window of opportunity during the
final stage of the NLS1 phase just before growing into broad-line AGNs.

powerful sources which host luminous quasars, we evaluated the broadband
emission spectra by properly taking into account adiabatic and radiative
cooling effects on the electron distribution. The synchrotron radiation
and inverse Compton (IC) scattering of various photons that are mainly
produced in the accretion disk and dusty torus are considered as
radiation processes. We show that the resultant radiation is dominated
by the IC emission for compact sources (lsim10 kpc), whereas the
synchrotron radiation is more important for larger sources. We also
compare shell emissions with those expected from the lobe under the
assumption that the fractions of the energy deposited in the shell and
lobe carried by non-thermal electrons are epsilon$_{ e }$ \~{} 0.01

emissions are brighter than lobe ones at infrared and optical bands when
the source size is gsim10 kpc, and the IC emissions from the shell at
gsim10 GeV can be observed with an absence of contamination from the
lobe irrespective of the source size. In particular, it is predicted

ratios in PG QSOs are similar to those of previously studied AGN
populations with lower luminosities, suggesting that AGN-nuclear
starburst connections are valid over a wide luminosity range of AGNs in
the local universe. The observed nuclear-starburst-to-AGN luminosity
ratios in PG QSOs with available supermassive black-hole masses are
comparable to a theoretical prediction based on the assumption that the

 abstract = "{Based on the physical model of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth
via gas accretion in a circumnuclear disk (CND) proposed by Kawakatu
{\amp} Wada, we describe the formation of high-z (z{\gt}6) quasars (QSOs)
whose BH masses are M $_{BH}${\gt}10$^{9}$ M $_{sun}$.
We derive the necessary conditions to form QSOs at z{\gt}6 by only gas
accretion: (1) a large mass supply with M
$_{sup}${\gt}10$^{10}$ M $_{sun}$from host galaxies to
CNDs, because the final BH mass is only 1\%-10\% of the total supplied
mass from QSO hosts. (2) High star formation efficiency for a rapid BH
growth which is comparable to high-z starburst galaxies such as
submillimeter galaxies. We also find that if the BH growth is limited by
the Eddington accretion, the final BH mass is greatly suppressed when
the period of mass supply from hosts, t $_{sup}$, is shorter than
the Eddington timescale. Thus, the super-Eddington growth is required
for the QSO formation while t $_{sup}$, which is determined by the
efficiency of angular momentum transfer, is shorter than \~{}10$^{8}$
yr. The evolution of the QSO luminosity depends on the redshift z
$_{i}$ at which accretion onto a seed BH is initiated. In other
words, the brighter QSOs at z{\gt}6 favor the late growth of SMBHs (i.e.,
z $_{i}$ {\ap} 10) rather than early growth (i.e., z $_{i}$
{\ap} 30). For z $_{i}$ {\ap} 10, t $_{sup}$ sime
10$^{8}$ yr is shorter than that of the star formation in the CND.
Thus, the gas in the CND can accrete onto a BH more efficiently,
compared with the case for z $_{i}$ {\ap} 30 (or t $_{sup}$
{\ap} 10$^{9}$ yr). Moreover, we predict the observable properties
and the evolution of QSOs at z{\gt}6. In a QSO phase, there should exist
a stellar rich massive CND, whose gas mass is about 10\% of the dynamical
mass inside \~{}0.1-1 kpc. On the other hand, in a phase where the BH grows
(i.e., a proto-QSO phase), the proto-QSO has a gas-rich massive CND
whose gas mass is comparable to the dynamical mass. Compared with the
observed properties of the distant QSO SDSS J1148+5251 observed at z =
6.42, we predict that SDSS J1148+5251 corresponds to the scenario of the
late growth of SMBH with z $_{i}$ \~{} 10, which is accompanied by a
massive CNDs with M $_{g}$ {\ap} 5 {\times} 10$^{10}$ M
$_{sun}$ and the luminous nuclear starburst L $_{SB}$at
infrared band with L $_{SB}$ {\ap} 10$^{47}$ erg
s$^{-1}$. Moreover, we predict that the progenitor of SDSS
J1148+5251 can be the super-Eddington object. These predictions can be
verified by ALMA, SPICA, and JWST.

be well understood by the difference in the spectral energy distribution

SED without a strong big blue bump (BBB), i.e., a radiatively
inefficient accretion flow (RIAF), while RQ AGNs are consistent with the
models adopting SED with a strong BBB, i.e., a geometrically thin,

ascribed to the change of the power-law index of ambient density profile
in the MSO phase (\~{}1 kpc). It is also found that the cocoon shape
becomes nearly spherical or disrupted for MSOs, while an elongated
morphology is predicted for CSOs and FR II galaxies. This seems to be
consistent with the higher fraction of distorted morphology of MSOs than
that of CSOs and FR II galaxies. Finally, we predict that only CSOs

distinct accretion modes depending on the gravitational stability of the
CND play a key role in accreting gas to a SMBH. (i) If the CND is
gravitationally unstable, energy feedback from supernovae supports a
geometrically thick, turbulent gas disk. The accretion in this mode is
dominated by turbulent viscosity, and it is significantly larger than
that in mode (ii), i.e., the CND is supported by gas pressure. Once the

supplied from the host galaxy to the central 100 pc region accretes onto
the SMBH even in the high-accretion phase (mode [i]), because part of
the gas is used to form stars. Outflow from the circumnuclear region
also suppresses the growth of the SMBH. As a result, the final SMBH mass
(M$_{BH,final}$) is not proportional to the total gas mass
supplied from the host galaxy (M$_{sup}$);
M$_{BH,final}$/M$_{sup}$ decreases with M$_{sup}$.
This would indicate that it is difficult to form a SMBH with
\~{}10$^{9}$ M$_{solar}$ observed for high-z quasi-stellar
objects. The evolution of the SMBH and CND would be related to the
evolutionary tracks of different types of AGNs. We find that the AGN
luminosity tightly correlates with the luminosity of the nuclear
starburst only in the high-accretion phase (mode [ii]). This implies
that the AGN-starburst connection depends on the evolution of the AGN
activity.

Our work shows that ALMA will be able to resolve and detect high-J

QSOs tended to show a sub-Eddington flow. On the basis of our findings,
we suggest that a central SMBH grows by changing its mass accretion rate

been predicted that a self-gravitating massive torus, whose mass is
larger than a central BH, exists in the early phase of BH growth (type 1

ULIRGs have systematically smaller BH masses in spite of the comparable

far-infrared luminosity of most type I ULIRGs is larger than the
Eddington luminosity. We show that the above results do not change
significantly for three type I ULIRGs for which we can estimate the

measurements and our sample bias to make sure that our results are not
altered even if we consider the above two effects. In addition, Anabuki
recently revealed that their X-ray properties are similar to those of
the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. These would indicate that active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) with a high mass accretion rate exist in type I
ULIRGs. On the basis of all of these findings, we conclude that it would
be a natural interpretation that type I ULIRGs are the early phase of BH

change in the dark matter potential enhances star formation in the

accretion via the radiation drag. Therefore, our model naturally

As a result, it is found that after a galactic wind epoch, the
luminosity is shifted from the host-dominant phase to the active
galactic nucleus-dominant phase (QSO phase) in the timescale of a few
10$^{8}$ yr. The former phase corresponds to the early stage of a
growing BH and can be regarded as a ``proto-QSO'' phase. It has
observable characteristic properties as follows: (1) The broad emission
lines are narrower than those of ordinary QSOs and are typically less
than 1500 km s$^{-1}$. (2) The BH-to-bulge mass ratio,
M$_{BH}$/M$_{bulge}$, is in the range of 10$^{-5.3}$
to 10$^{-3.9}$. (3) Host galaxies are bluer than QSO hosts, by
about 0.5 mag in the colors B-V at the rest bands and V-K at the
observed bands, with assumed galaxy formation redshifts of
z$_{f}$=3-5. (4) The metallicity of gas in the galactic nuclei is
\~{}8 Z$_{solar}$ and that of stars weighted by the host luminosity
is \~{}3 Z$_{solar}$. (5) The central massive BH (\~{}=10$^{7}$
M$_{solar}$) is surrounded by a massive dusty disk
({\gt}10$^{8}$ M$_{solar}$), which may obscure the nucleus in
the edge-on view and make a type 2 nucleus. By comparing these
predictions with recent observations, radio galaxies are a possible
candidate for proto-QSOs. Also, it is anticipated that the proto-QSO
phase is preceded by an optically thick phase, which may correspond to
ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). In this phase,
M$_{BH}$/M$_{bulge}$ is predicted to be much less than

ULIRGs, optically thin star-forming galaxies are predicted. These may be

numerically solve the relativistic radiation hydrodynamical equation
coupled with accurate radiative transfer, and quantitatively assess the
radiation drag efficiency. As a result, we find that in an optically
thick regime the radiation drag efficiency is sensitively dependent on
the density distributions of the interstellar medium (ISM). The
efficiency drops according to {$\tau$}T-2 in an optically thick uniform
ISM, where {$\tau$}$_{T}$ is the total optical depth of the dusty
ISM, whereas the efficiency remains almost constant at a high level if
the ISM is clumpy. Hence, if bulge formation begins with a star
formation event in a clumpy ISM, the radiation drag will effectively
work to remove the angular momentum and the accreted gas may form a
supermassive black hole. As a natural consequence, this mechanism
reproduces a putative linear relation between the mass of a supermassive
black hole and the mass of a galactic bulge, although further detailed
modelling for stellar evolution is required for a more precise
