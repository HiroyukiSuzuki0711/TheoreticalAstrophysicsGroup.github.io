 abstract = "{The hyperluminous X-ray source HLX-1 in the galaxy ESO 243-49, currently
the best intermediate-mass black hole (BH) candidate, displays spectral
transitions similar to those observed in Galactic BH binaries, but with
a luminosity 100-1000 times higher. We investigated the X-ray properties
of this unique source by fitting multi-epoch data collected by Swift,
XMM-Newton, and Chandra with a disk model computing spectra for a wide
range of sub- and super-Eddington accretion rates assuming a
non-spinning BH and a face-on disk (i = 0{\deg}). Under these assumptions
we find that the BH in HLX-1 is in the intermediate-mass range (\~{}2
{\times} 10$^{4}$ M $_{&sun;}$) and the accretion flow is in
the sub-Eddington regime. The disk radiation efficiency is {$\eta$} = 0.11
{\plusmn} 0.03. We also show that the source does follow the
L$_{X}$ vprop T $^{4}$ relation for our mass estimate. At
the outburst peaks, the source radiates near the Eddington limit. The
accretion rate then stays constant around 4 {\times} 10$^{-4}$ M
$_{&sun;}$ yr$^{-1}$ for several days and then decreases
exponentially. Such ''plateaus'' in the accretion rate could be evidence
that enhanced mass-transfer rate is the driving outburst mechanism in
HLX-1. We also report on the new outburst observed in 2011 August by the
Swift X-Ray Telescope. The time of this new outburst further strengthens
the \~{}1 year recurrence timescale.

 abstract = "{Context: .Scatter around the relationship between central black hole
masses in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) obtained by
reverberation-mapping methods and host-galaxy bulge velocity dispersion
indicates that the masses are uncertain typically by a factor of about
three.<BR /> Aims: .In this paper, we try to identify the sources and
systematics of this uncertainty.<BR /> Methods: .We characterize the
broad H{$\beta$} emission-line profiles by the ratio of their full-width at
half maximum (FWHM) to their line dispersion, i.e., the second moment of
the line profile. We use this parameter to separate the
reverberation-mapped AGNs into two populations, the first with narrower
H{$\beta$} lines that tend to have relatively extended wings, and the
second with broader lines that are relatively flat-topped. The first
population is characterized by higher Eddington ratios than the second.
Within each population, we calibrate the black-hole mass scale by
comparison of the reverberation-based mass with that predicted by the
bulge velocity dispersion. We also use the distribution of ratios of the
reverberation-based mass to the velocity-dispersion mass prediction in a
comparison with a ''generalized thick disk'' model in order to see if
inclination can plausibly account for the observed distribution.<BR />
Results: .We find that the line dispersion is a less biased parameter in
general than FWHM for black hole mass estimation, although we show that
it is possible to empirically correct for the bias introduced by using
FWHM to characterize the emission-line width. We also argue that
inclination effects are apparent only in some small subset of the
reverberation-based mass measurements; it is primarily the objects with
the narrowest emission lines that seem to be most strongly affected.<BR
/> Conclusions: .Our principal conclusion is that the H{$\beta$} profile is
sensitive primarily to Eddington ratio, but that inclination effects
play a role in some cases.

 abstract = "{We use the BH masses deduced from the empirical relation of Kaspi et al.
(2000) between the size of the Broad Line Region (BLR) of Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and the optical luminosity, to compute their
accretion rates in four samples of AGN, assuming that the optical
luminosity is provided by the accretion disc. We show that Narrow Line
Seyfert Galaxies 1 (NLS1s) accrete at super-Eddington rates, while their
luminosity stays of the order of the Eddington limit. We take into
account the possibility of a non-viscous energy release inversely
proportional to the square of the distance in the gravitationally
unstable region of the disc emitting a fraction of the optical
luminosity. It leads to a smaller accretion rate and to a redder
continuum than a standard disc, which agrees better with the
observations. The observed bolometric luminosities appear to saturate at
a few times the Eddington luminosity for super-Eddington accretion
rates, as predicted by slim disc models. They favor a Kerr BH rather
than a Schwarzschild one. Even when the accretion rate is
super-Eddington, it stays always of the order of a few
M$_{&sun;}$/yr, irrespective of the BH mass, indicating that the
growing of the BH is mass-supply-limited and therefore regulated by an
exterior mechanism, and not Eddington-limited. The mass of the BH
increases by one order of magnitude in a few 10$^{7}$ years, a
time smaller than that necessary for changing the bulge mass. This is in
agreement with recent claims that the BHs of NLS1s do not follow the
same black hole - bulge relation as other galaxies. Since they represent
about 10\% of AGN up to a redshift of 0.5, these ``super-active'' phases
should play an important role in shaping the mass function of local BHs.
We finally discuss the possibility that the masses could be
systematically underestimated due to an inclination effect, and we
conclude that this could indeed be the case, and that the accretion
rates could thus be strongly overestimated in a small fraction of
objects, possibly explaining the existence of apparently extremely high
accretors.

seem to amount to {\tilde} 10-30\% of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the
local universe. Together with their average accretion rate, we argue
that a black hole (BH) growth by factor of 8-800 happens in these
super-Eddington accretion phase of AGNs. Moreover, there is a possible,
systematic underestimation of accretion rates (in the Eddington unit)
due to an overestimation of BH mass by massive accretion discs for
super-Eddington objects. If it is true, the factor of BH growth above
may be larger by order(s) of magnitude. In contrast, the growth factor
expected in sub-Eddington phase is only {\tilde} 2. Therefore, the cosmic
BH growth by accretion is likely dominated by super-Eddington phase,
rather than sub-Eddington phase which is the majority among AGNs.

This analysis is based on the fraction and the average accretion rate of
NLS1s and NLQs obtained for z {\lsim} 0.5. If those numbers are larger at
higher redshift (where BHs were probably less grown), super-Eddington
accretion would be even more important in the context of cosmic BH
growth history.

 abstract = "{Self-gravitating accretion discs have only been studied in a few nearby
objects using maser spots at the parsec-scale. We find a new spectral
window for observing the self-gravitating accretion disc in
super-Eddington accreting Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). This window is
determined by calculating the outermost radius (r$_{sg}$) of a non
self-gravitating disc and the corresponding emission wavelength
({$\lambda$}$_{sg}$) as a function of various disc parameters. We
find that {$\lambda$}$_{sg}$ reaches {\tilde}4000  {\AA} for
{$\alpha$}=0.1, when M$_{&sun;}$ {\gsim} 70   (M$_{BH}$ /
10$^{7}$  M$_{&sun;}$)$^{-1}$
L$_{Edd}$/c$^{2}$ (where {\amp}alpha,; M$_{&sun;}$,
M$_{BH}$ and L$_{Edd}$ are, respectively, the viscosity
parameter, gas accretion rate onto the central black hole (BH), the BH
mass and the Eddington luminosity). Moreover, {$\lambda$}$_{sg}$ is
as small as {\tilde} 1500  {\AA} for {$\alpha$} =0.001, which is the
smallest {$\alpha$} case in this study. Therefore, the window for observing
the self-gravitating part of an AGN accretion disc is from {\tilde} 2
{$\mu$}m to {$\lambda$}$_{sg}$. Incidentally, r$_{sg}$ can be less
than the photon trapping radius for M$_{&sun;}$ {\gsim}
10$^{3.3}$ L$_{Edd}$/c$^{2}$. Namely, a
self-gravitating, optically-thick, advection-dominated accretion disc is
expected to appear in the extremely high accretion rate regime.

Next, we demonstrate that the Mid-Infrared to X-ray spectrum of a
bright, well-studied Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy, Ton S 180, is indeed
well fitted by the spectrum arising from the following three components:
an inner slim disc (with a corona), an outer, self-gravitating
non-Keplerian disc and a dusty torus. The total mass, BH mass plus the
entire disc mass, is found to be about (1.4 - 8.0)  M$_{BH}$. If
the surface density varies with radius r in proportion to
r$^{-0.6}$, the total mass is consistent with the central mass
estimated by H$\backslash$beta and [O III] widths.

with that of the recent paper by Krolik, in which a warm absorber is
strongly inhomogeneous. Such a situation is possible in the so-called
multiphase medium, where regions with different ionization states,
densities, and temperatures may coexist in thermal equilibrium under
constant pressure. We illustrate this scenario with theoretical spectra
of radiation transferred through a stratified cloud with constant
pressure (instead of constant density) computed by the TITAN code in
plane-parallel approximation. Detected spectral features are faint, and
their presence does not alter the broadband continuum. We model the
broadband continuum of Ton S180 assuming an irradiated accretion disk
with a dissipative warm skin. The set of parameters appropriate for the
data cannot be determined uniquely, but models with low values of the
black hole mass have too hot and radially extended a warm skin to
explain the formation of soft X-ray disk lines seen in the data.

fraction of accretion energy released in the corona, depend strongly on
the rate of incoming mass flow from the outer edge of the disk, a larger
rate leading to more Compton cooling, less efficient evaporation, and a
weaker corona. We also found a strong dependence on the viscosity, with
higher viscosity leading to an enhanced mass flow in the corona and
therefore more evaporation of gas from the disk below. If we take
accretion rates in units of the Eddington rate, our results become
independent of the mass of the central black hole. The model predicts
weaker contributions to the hard X-rays for objects with higher
accretion rate like narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, in agreement with
observations. For luminous active galactic nuclei, strong Compton
cooling in the innermost corona is so efficient that a large amount of
additional heating is required to maintain the corona above the thin
