Recent observations have confirmed that the relationship between the mass of the supermassive black hole in the center of galaxies and the the mass of the elliptical component of the galaxy (galactic bulge) exists universally, and that the mass ratio is always about 1/2000. This indicates that supermassive black hole formation is closely linked to galaxy formation. But the mechanism that links the two is not known. The purpose of this workshop is to close in on the origin of this correlation, by inspiring discussions that combine theory, simulations, and observations, and come up with new break-through ideas towards elucidating the coevolution mechanism.
